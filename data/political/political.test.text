tillis did not cut the education budget .
where were months ago .
has done nothing but cave to dems ! !
i think rubio has made a strong showing tonight .
we support you , rand .
tom , i wish u would bring change .
i will continue praying for you and the decisions made by our government !
we need more trey gowdy &apos;s in the world !
better late than never you idiot !
if you vote for ryan , you will never get another vote from me .
congrats roger !
he thinks he &apos;s a king !
do you not hear the american people saying no , to illegals and mydlims ?
sir scott , a limited attack will make any solution for syria nearly impossible .
do not give in to his stupidity !
repost if you think god , our country , and our flag deserve respect !
i copy mr white &apos;s statement : mr. lankford .
how obama is still in office lays at the republican leadership door .
get off your duff and submit the zadroga legislation .
marco is the one we have been waiting for !
you are nothing but a partisan hack paid off by the likes of devos
cave .
love you trey gowdy you are the best we have ! ! !
we stand with you mr. paul !
don &apos;t doa paul ryan please ...
this attack against online poker is an attack on our individual freedom .
he thought he could keep ryan off track .
sir she is woefully unqualified .
in the private sector , they would be fired .
ga. does not care if a person lives or dies .
but obama is a ---hole .
vote no on every illegal gubment spending bill that comes down the pipe justin .
tom woods is a guy you should associate yourself with .
i have the same questions tim has .
how the hell is it that holder is still around ?
obama has violated our laws he should be impeached .
tell him what you think !
it also demonstrates why government should stay out of health care
rand paul can go for a giant leap on a short pier
lol then why raise the debt ceiling ?
i am also proud to be a product of the sc public school system .
few good people like you , trey gowdy and ted cruz ! ! !
washington must stop spending and borrowing money ! ! !
but most of all being an american means following the constitution and being brave .
why a vote for cloture that is a vote for obomacare
praying for a complete recovery for amanda .
any time james .
one wants secure borders , one wants open borders .
wow a representative being pro active .. love trey
the republicans have sent several balanced budget admin and dems won &apos;t pass them .
many who have ran out of time for government funds are not counted .
the president is clearly within his legal authority with this executive action .
so you going to impeach him ?
you were my second choice ( after trump ) in the republican primary .
this libertarian is pro-choice , on everything .
go get them trey gowdy ! üòÅ
obama broke the law again , telling illegals they could vote for the president .
try asking ross perot why his third party attempt was killed ...
siding with harry reid is no compromise .
actually somebody should send him a copy of &quot; the law &quot;
please stand with your constituents and vote to defund obama &quot; care . &quot;
i cannot support betsy devos as secretary of education .
our prayers are with all families affected by that nut job .
lindsey go home you don &apos;t have a chance .
lets not forget that obamas team will never waste a good crises .
you haven &apos;t called him down on anything not have you done your jobs
we don &apos;t need a balanced budget amendment that is rammed through in haste .
rejoice , lee .
you really should try reading that constitution again .
god bless you guys !
hey trey gowdy , you &apos;d make a great president .
i &apos;d say our man mitch just self destructed .
just hang in there , tim .
thumbs up for ted cruz ( y )
you are clearly not republican anymore !
can we start printing gowdy 2020 stickers yet ?
obam &apos;s illegal act is factually an of treason .
you and chambliss sold us out .
reps cave in for their own purpose .
you &apos;re our hero rand .
you need to take a lesson from trey gowdy !
if he does arrest him
rep lamborn i hope you do not believe that .
its time to audit obama &apos;s lavish vacations as well .
gowdy has been bought .
jerry , you make assumuntions ... and , you can &apos;t spell !
hey fellow patriots sign here ! ! !
you won &apos;t get my support again and will get more prayers .
lol - little marco
it &apos;s time for crist to shut or put up !
sorry , lindsey , but you &apos;re only half right .
obama is the poorest president we have had since the 1800 &apos;s
praying for more people to believe the same as you !
you go , the lord is with you .
stop all foreign aid until &quot; we the people &quot; are all o.k.
which one is that sir ?
flake the flake , you must think we are so stupid .
obama needs to be stopped
pass a budget and raise the debt ceiling .
praying for you , your husband and the baby .
first , we need to truly secure our borders .
hear our voices and &quot; draw the line &quot; mr. mcclintock !
get a leader who will lead and not cave .
a no vote at this time seems the responsible action .
the president does not care about spending , he can tax us more
and what exactly are you doing sir to &quot; bring us all together ? &quot;
that everything that obummer and his posse have done becomes null and void .
allen west , louie gohmert , mark meadows , or mark levin ; )
fair like merrick garland ?
do you support or oppose the government shutdown ?
the dictator doesn &apos;t give a flying phoque about the law .
mia , please start a petition we the people can sign as well !
beg your tea party to nominate a challenger to the traitor thune
i really like this senator ... this country needs more patriots like him .
i believe you &apos;re history in sc !
this isn &apos;t a left vs right decision , this is qualified vs unqualified .
that is why the president is ignoring it !
wish you all the best marco .
you can start the impeachment process now . , got that done tonight .
could you libnuts please vacate the state of texas before you ruin it ?
why no air cover ?
supporting rubio in like supporting isis .
our government needs a wake up call before it is to late .
congressman gowdy- i am not a constituent from sc , i live in tn .
no more common core it needs to end !
you know , i thought rinos were near extinction .
sir , what are you doing about the border ?
find another republican nominee who &apos;s actually qualified .
we should be spending our tax dollars improving public schools , not undermining them .
you want the tsa to hire proctologists and gynecologists to work the screening lines ?
obama reopened relations with cuba because cuba is communist .
don &apos;t even bring the senate immigration bill to the floor for discussion .
they gave obama a free ride by passing his budget .
unnecessary foreign aid is also a big issue .
impeach and remove from office , please .
rand paul , you are a good man !
she has absolutely no knowledge of education or how to manage educational funds .
no way should that be allowed
thune in &apos; 12 !
lamar is such a disappointment .
praying for you : )
the republican party should have gave the american people an electible candidate !
fight obamacare - the massive government takeover of our healthcare ! !
kind of like the media.well you just go ahead , traitor to your party .
marsha is crazy as a loon .
well said mia , we love you : )
i am praying for all of isreal to remain safe .
praise god that change is on the way
get rid of current republican leadership
get over to the senate chamber and support rand paul .
push them harder tom !
because he thinks we &apos;re all stupid enough to believe him .
you are a disgrace and a traitor !
listed below are what the ratings were a few months ago !
mr. ryan , make no mistake .
i am not seeing the action start legal matters on this president for treason .
since when does emperor obama care about the constitution ?
surely , the republicans can find someone better then devos .
john mccain called him that .
in obama &apos;s administration , this seems to be a requirement for employment .
how about getting the flag to fly half mast at the white house .
america needs a patriot like you !
no deductions or credits .
no amnesty for these law breaking illegals .
you and sen. tillis had the best seats in the house !
@ mike , i so agree with you ! !
sadly you are a weak candidate for the republican party .
pray you are right about that .
he wants to eliminate it entirely ,
obama is good at shutting jobs down , not so good at finding them .....
pray for him to resign
they represent the people of sc .
you need to watch those videos again , sir .
business as usual by rinos and dems
gowdy has to uncover the truth no matter where it goes .
so are all of congress and sente members and their famiies exempt from obama care
excellent job dr paul !
i see a veto pen ! !
president ben carson ! ! ! ! !
amen to you congressman love !
people don &apos;t have a flag problem .
where was perdue and other gop blowhards when bush lost 5 million emails .
i agree he had his chance
my prayers are with the families of the victims &amp; the people of charleston .
amen tom cotton !
marco , please save us !
no authoriy ! ...
no bipartisanship ?
i was the one who asked about constitutional carry .
you need to get on the same plane as killery and obama
ok , what next sir .
shame that you are a rino .
i &apos;m thankful we have men like trey gowdy in government .
i share all your posts , bruce !
i am with rubio all the way !
we already know that and you wimps in dc do nothing about it .
keep taking on the left , mia .
mccain can &apos;t be trusted on either side .
no vote on devos or it will be a no vote on your re-election .
math has nothing to do with republican or democrat , conservative or liberal .
i would vote for trey gowdy for president and support his campaign .
maybe this is why impeachment proceedings has not been enacted .
say no to renewal of overreaching , 2nd amendment unfriendly patriot act .
we the people want a balanced approach with revenues and spending cuts .
very disappointed johnny .
pass a budget and protect the constitution .
i only wish our senators from idaho would have stood with you ... disappointing .
cut the government off !
it is way past time and maybe too late
mr. buchanan should delist the author such antics .
the worst part is that odumba probably agreed with his socialist views .
you swore an oath when you took office to protect the constitution from tyranny .
this administration has done much more wrong than president nixon .
i am so frustrated with you , mr. isakson !
you are right , continue to oppose this ... mcminnville , tn .
ronald reagan was the last stand up respectable politician this country has seen !
no one in dc is standing up to him .
look at john mccain on my facebook page !
lets not only repeal it but replace it with meaningful health care legislation .
the old guard will never receive another penny from this republican .
keep fighting the good fight mia ! !
we are not talking about individuals sir .
no need to say more ! ! !
nice try , should have backed him months ago .
stand your ground don &apos;t buckle defund obamacare
may god bless you in your endeavors .
and sen. paul , what did the cuban people get in these deal ?
obama is blowing sand .
i have no hope !
god bless you tim ! !
poe for president !
sen. rand one of the exceptions .
from the birth certificate , bengahzi , irs and obamacare
no pay increases to representatives or senators until a balanced budget is achieved .
he misses one half of his morning security briefings per wh reports .
when are we going to impeach this guy and get our country back
pass a clean cr and stop the bs .
we need to stop spending .
yay mia ! !
ever time we saw dave obey , we thought , you &apos;re fired !
thanks , mr lankford .
how about a real town hall meeting ?
tom mcclintock is a great man - one politican we need to keep !
west and rubio are the future , lets get them in 2016 !
i hope you can stop our muslim dictator at all cost .
how did the gop go from mccain to trump ? ? ? ?
rock the boat &amp; go johnny go ! !
your fb site should be &quot; mia love fox news ii &quot; .
i appreciate your posts and your stand for jesus !
i watched the entire debate .
you continue to make the south and the people of georgia look horrible .
love of country and the constitution cannot be wrong .
if they are capable , they should be allowed to be in combat .
either your a loyalist corrupted patriot or a freedom constitutional patriot .
i pray for you all every day .
may blame us but obama is really responsible .
merry christmas from port st. lucie , florida
you guys in washington are so out of touch with americans ,
support the texas plan , please , rep. poe !
those trashing ted are simply jealous .
happy independence day rep. love !
after voting for that budget bil you need to pray
the aca or obamacare is unconstitutional .
why does obama put illegal aliens ahead of americans .
how about you showing up to vote on issues lindsey
keep on them sir don &apos;t give them one inch
it &apos;s time to recognize that obama is a socialist .
many feel the entire republican party is a total failure .
if my co-worker voted for obama , i would divorce him !
who is the big government big spending candidate ?
no government loans ! ! ! ! !
don &apos;t care what he thinks
we &apos;re with you here in iowa , rand !
a flat tax would certainly encourage spending and investment too !
the corruption of this administration is beyond belief !
what would jesus do ? ?
he has only one thing to lose by being unconstitutional .
anyone on here slamming paul for his comments is not very well educated .
it is because of the spending that we are in this predicament .
pass a clean cr and raise the debt limit before you do anything else .
no , this obama plan is for everyone except the elected officials in d.c.
great american god bless you !
make them cave .
we put our faith in our god .
stay strong , tom !
have we not learned nothing , sir ?
i hope the republican party is paying attention !
no chance
mr. o takes liberties , with our liberties .
semper fi , senator mccain
just like obama and the epa putting legislation in to stop lead production ?
get off social media and do something about sir ! ! !
it is a shame we cannot take away all power from this administration now !
the president is not allowed to have any control over our federal funds .
yes it is clear and the answer is rand paul .
sell it somewhere else , with all due respect mr. isakson .
i cant wait for 2012 ... i voted mccain and would do it again .
i believe engaging any communist country is communist friendly , thus communistic .
so this is a case of too little , too late , georgia senators .
why aren &apos;t you impeaching , tom ?
have you seen this number on his communist membership card # 5570347 ?
the first thing is to repeal the patriot act .
too little too late speaker ! !
thanks scott someone really is on our side out here , bless you !
i like you john thune .
there was no immigration in 1952. it was shut down .
repeal repeal repeal !
don &apos;t raise the debt limit !
the liberal sheeple have no clue what is going on in this country !
even better idea no taxes
why are we allowing illegal aliens to stay here illegally ?
no , lindsey .
no amnesty to illegals allowed .
we stand with rand paul .
the gun didn &apos;t do it and the flag didn &apos;t do it .
give &apos; em hell , mr king !
the patriot act would make our founding fathers puke in their boots .
they wont start out paying taxes is my understanding
i &apos;m quite sure he will cave and do the latter .
i can &apos;t do it , paul .
how about mr mcclintock ?
great idea mr. isakson = vote &quot; present &quot; ! ! ! ! !
you &apos;re in luck mia - you can rest easy .
no more war senator unless you are sending your son .
you did not make the list of those ousting boehner .
i am docent for the reagan ranch center .
i hope yall stick to this
happy thanksgiving to you and your family , i am praying for you .
itt : people who love obamacare but live in another district .
mr. walden needs to move on .
since when is an eagle a &quot; wacko bird &quot; ?
megyn kelly should be fired .
in fact , you had some tax payment issues yourself .
hill rat said turner was for shutting down if obamacare was not repealed .
ronald reagan every damn day .
the federal reserve has been printing 86 billion a month and buying bonds .
we conservatives want what &apos;s right for our country !
i &apos;ll always stand with a leader and patriot
past leaders should have been doing this all along .
a sad day for north carolina and the usa .
this land belongs to we the people !
give it up mike .
i look up to you , senator scott .
i voted for you to support conservative values in a republic .
we don &apos;t care what you think traitor !
i &apos;ve listened to mcclintock .
he should have been voted out of office when he said that .
of course he supports his dad .
so , does rand need a pizza sent his way ?
he knows he is above the law !
i agree mike .
# slimshadygraham ... sir / ma &apos;am you are an embarrassment to south carolina !
praying for all amen !
so impeach obama already
ya too late ryan .... your not ok with me
these military men and women are trained with weapons , duh !
the tax code should be for generating revenue .
gowdy love mode activated
surely in the south we could do alot more with solar power ! !
might have made a difference a couple months ago .
all of senate needs to answer for betrying constitution , if we had real doj
marsha blackburn jeb hensarling .
trump and christie have littel to no integrity .
or at least has a no confidence vote held ?
spending on stuff we don &apos;t need like robotic squirrels .
god bless you and all those who have reelected you .
the entire senate nearly just voted to fund americas enemies tonight .
looks like sc might have a bunch democratic congressional members come next election .
let &apos;s not reward folks who break our immigration laws , plain &amp; simple .
did it occur to you that obama does not want to lower unemployment ?
isn &apos;t that god &apos;s job ?
your a little too late to the party !
mr buchanan i suppot your views on this .
@ bae jae ho graham represents sc , not the usa .
elect rand paul for president in 2016 .
we may not understand it but god has a plan .
further evidence that government should never be trusted .
he has enough money to do it .
get rid of obama would help !
he needs to be arrested for treason , thrown in jail and impeached .
i am a sc resident and couldn &apos;t oppose her appointment more .
rand , this is too logical a choice for washington .
our gift from a risen lord ! ! !
guess you should have to suffer under my rino marsha blackburn .
congressman jason chaffetz is one of the good guys .
please reconsider and vote how georgians want you to .
regrettably is is not a debate about freedom and socialism .
no i do not support raising the debt ceiling !
just say no and defund obamacare ! !
rep. mchenry vietnam veterans of america - positions 100 % terry .
clemson 56 , wake forest 7 ! !
obama is our worst president to date .
senator lindsey graham has started horribly .
thom tillis , all the way ! !

i am so proud to be watching senator enzi right now !
now you back him you idiot !
nice work , rep. elise stefanik .
were praying for you capt .
the flag did not kill 9 people a deranged nut did .
has &quot; we the people &quot; lost its meaning and intent ?
no comment .....
we need more conservatives in d.c. just like you .
rubio , bush , carson and kasich totally impressed me .
mr. gowdy , please seriously consider a run for president .
my family quit watching broadcast tv after the media voted obama in .
the feds don &apos;t know how to do anything right except spend money .
i &apos;m interested to hear mitch &apos;s opinion on defending our borders and on isis
you can prove holder is lying .
i am amazed at this outrage on benghazi .
securing our borders would be a great place to start !
praying our nation will thrive under our new leaders .
you and the rnc have let him do this on his own ! ! !
it allows companies to hire the illegals with no medical expense to the company .
so , little barry soetoro will de-fund our troops ?
your views of mrs. devos point to why nc is falling behind in education .
a paul ryan endorsement is likely to send any non-rino ito your opponent .
when putin looks more competent than our president ... maybe its time we impeach !
any future funding conversations should include balanced budget requirement .
sure , do not continue the unconstitutional patriot act .
sounds good trey doesn &apos;t it ? ?
jefferson and reagan would agree .
... now ... what &apos;s holding things up is obamacare .
when we give up freedom for security we deserve neither .
conservative review gives ryan an &quot; f &quot; rating .
he hates america and christians ! !
congratulations , johnny and dianne !
talk is cheap and &quot; we the people &quot; are not stupid .
i love this mcclintock
now he is caving on our 2nd amendment !
what are you doing to make sure boehner and mcconnell don &apos;t cave ?
tim , please reread your post and try to learn some english .
then get on board with the people &apos;s choice for gop .
appreciate your wyoming common-sense .
shut the border down first then worry about all these illegals .
tell me rand , when can i start campaigning for you in florida ?
sorry congressman you lost my vote next election .
we love hearing our elected representatives stand up for us for a change !
our constitution is a minister for our good .
stand tall for paul !
marco gave a stunning speech ...
senator ben sasse you should have represented your party from the start .
wake up and look mr. sasse , if you have any integrity left .
so well put , rand .
obama has done enough damage to the country already .
impeach the stupid sob and get on with things already .
she is not the only one to blame for that tax fiasco .
out-of-control spending .
trey do something please !
i think separating dhs funding from amnesty is the right thing to do .
go jump off a cliff
as you know from other senator portman let us down .
and we will all pray for your success !
ain &apos;t no way washington would send their new tax revenue to the states .
we trust that u sir will be looking out for people an defund obumas care
i had a lot of respect for reagan .
and vote no on betsy devos while you &apos;re at it .
there were candidates like you mentioned .
i think graham is obsessed with benghazi .
y &apos;all talking about pot ?
i don &apos;t believe that the president wants to do anything about isis .
they can give themselves a pay raise but cannot cut spending
ted poe needs to be our president !
it is just one more sign that he needs to be replaced .
shut down the irs and the federal reserve .
the epa is not allowed under the us constitution .
there are only 20 patriots in the house of representatives .
god bless this country and god bless you , mr. lankford .
mccarthy is a vote for boehner .
however i do not agree with you mr. mccain .
i will not vote for senator sasse .
i &apos;m mean really ... re read the constitution and do your job .
amen , senator scott !
bravo mia love !
if you vote for cloture you own obamacare .
over half the country just wants to tread water .
sorry sir but you are not the conservative i thought you were .
you are doing great marsha .
the sob in our wh puts them before veterans ... talk about it ... !
i recognize your service to our state and nation but i would add impeach obama
your support for this republican candidate should have been unshaken from the very beginning .
for the president , money comes from a federal fund set aside for candidates .
! that &apos;s why we pay taxes , for us not them !
arrest him ; breaking the law again and again
you have honored the men you died in benghazi .
isakson is a traitor to republicans .
did you overlook the freedoms that will be given up ?
i support a fair tax that abolishes the irs and everyone pays .
she is absolutely not qualified to make those decisions .
you should be trying to impeach .
oh , good lord , ben and steph .
she is no where near qualified and you know it .
you &apos;re in south dakota .
jeff if the border is not secured we all lose .
rand you have my vote !
well , i would say nothing but treasonous politicians in washington ! ! ! !
now will come the debates on the debt ceiling .
and congress does nothing to stop anything .
i stand with rand paul ... you didn &apos;t !
obama is above the law don &apos;t you all know .
my opinion only , free speech , core of the constitution ! !
god bless you rand paul , you are a true american ! ! !
illegals may break our laws .
i &apos;m very disappointed in both senators from tennessee .
please pass the zadroga act and support our 911 first responders !
ask your speaker for a clean bill to vote on .
the previous president took on isis and they lost serious ground .
&quot; no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms . &quot;
mccain hates the usa and is only in congress for the money .
since when do you side with him in removing fellow conservatives from leadership positions ?
you got guts rand i respect you very much .
so i really don &apos;t understand you logic on this rand paul .
senator mccain , please do not give in to this undemocratic president .
and for a traitor no less !
there &apos;s so many common sense things that could cut spending .
please reconsider your options .
first order of business , the current speaker of the house has to go !
you outta be in it sir .
very simple : no spot inspections - no deal ! ! ! !
graham goes where the money goes .
jon because cain was better looking ! ! !
he doesn &apos;t care what we the people want ... he never has .
are we still sending aid to syria ?
we saw the true colors when we gave the republicans the house and senate !
y &apos;all wasted your time , the senate will not vote on this .
keep making inroads rand .
i am not a union member but i am an concerned educated georgia voter .
was eisenhower a socialist or a communist ?
is he sounding the alarm like another paul , i &apos;m talking paul revere ?
finally finally finally someone sticks up for america !
to rand paul : well done sir .
my main questionsto you is aiding and comforting the enemy still considered treason ?
more miracles are coming--thank the lord !
i call for all rino &apos;s to resign
respectfully , donald wicker 5510 calhoun dr. lot 17
senator , please do not vote to fund anything that includes obamacare ! !
please let sc show others we don &apos;t need to demonstrate .
why are you and the entire republican party dragging your feet ? ? ?
yay cruz and you and paul ! !
you might just be the republican nominee right now .
do you know why obama wants closed meetings with-out media ? ?
has anyone even read or understand the constitution ?
where the hell were you months ago when your party needed your endorsement ? ?
will you support replacing speaker boehner if he tries to ram the bill through ?
i say raise the debt ceiling only an equal amount of government cuts !
fine don &apos;t talk about it just do the job we hired you for .
congrats .. pls fight for the constitution
you do us proud sir ! !
eliminating the estate tax is another special tax cut for the wealthy .
the latest oklahoma stabbing and beheading is more than workplace violence .
may god keep you wise and strong !
unclear on the concept of why a country needs secure borders .
the dumping of refugees in tennessee must end .
enough of this &quot; fiscal cliff &quot; bs , protect our 2nd amendment right !
i vote for trey maybe someday we will be pulling for you thanks mia
i ask that you please reconsider your decision .
we love you , johnny !
i am praying someone does .
that &apos;s why the assclown obama needs to be placed in jail .
that &apos;s why you , rubio , lost ! !
the flag coming down had created more problems .
he is no match comparing to ronald reagan
thanks senator for standing with ted cruz and mike lee .
america didn &apos;t elect such a majority because of john boehner .
the republican party needs a purge .. in the worst way ... : -p
i dont know about you anymore rand
the debt ceiling is not the place for that debate .
so proud of you marco !
what do i care what that rino says ? !
and then there are the sell-outs who abandon conservative principles for financial gain .
mr. poe , you can &apos;t have it both ways !
pass the zadroga act ! !
we should not be negotiating with iran .
garn luke you sure have a lot of liberal friends lol
not good , marco rubio .
yes the fair tax would be great .
repealing it will hurt my family .
voting no would be treasonous
praying for wisdom for you man .
as for the fact he really doesn &apos;t know what he is doing also .
this is not what our founding fathers had in mind !
happy , happy birthday , marsha !
get trey gowdy as speaker !
yet the irs and insurance companies are hiring !
there are 35 muslim terrorist training camps on our soil .
we want our constitutional rights not threaded to be infringed upon .
we definitely need more like mia love .
thank god , rand &apos;s still talking !
it seems pretty much unanimous to me that we think devos is unfit .
you must do your job as a voice of the sc people .
good job mia could not said it better
very frustrating to see congress and the pres still draw a salary during this .
already praying for you to be relected .
happy thanksgiving trey and family , keep up the good work in dc .
she will wreck our schools .
that he has submitted his resignation .
haha i &apos;m talking to chad mccain right now .. ; )
this applies to congressmen from either party .
senator john mccain is the poster child for term limits .
entire countries do not burn our flag .
its simple vote republican !
forgive my sins oh lord and hear my prayer .
you work for the people of ga. start listening to us .
mrs. devos is horribly unqualified .
doesn &apos;t congress control the purse strings ?
seems like the paul &apos;s are an extremely rare breed in washington .
several billion out there in tax revenue from online poker !
happy thanksgiving to you and your family as well mr. gowdy
sorry tim , no like your act !
what about the feds coming and taking the family computers and wiping them out ?

defeat him and his plan to destroy this great country .
vern , get off my facebook .

he has never represented oklahoma .
stand with mitch &amp; rand !
quit wasting bandwidth .
won &apos;t somebody impeach him ?
i &apos;m not angry mr mccain , i &apos;m sad and wondering ; why ?
worry about whats happening within our own borders .
during the presidential campaign , mr morsi has promised an evergreen future .
can &apos;t stand him for what he has done to our country .
you hire 16,000 irs agents to enforce the law .
not with obama as pres .
veralie mae smith - columbia , sc

# worstresponders stop shaming the state of kentucky with your greed .
so they won &apos;t hate us anymore , duh !

the amendment allows epa to overreach .
conservatives think government has it &apos;s boundries and liberal think government bloated boundries .
i wish mr. buffet would write a check to me .
you sir have lost my future vote ! ! ! &apos;
this president has allowed murder to take pleace while he went to bed .
term limits should be set for all aspects of government .
that &apos;s ok ted !
impeach him this time and it won &apos;t happen again .
sir , you have given me hope again for our country .
why haven &apos;t you men elected stood up to him ? ?
is there a reason why we can not have a flat rate tax system ?
that &apos;s why i &apos;m a constitutional conservative , not a republican .
get rid of obama care please .
you rank right there with mcconnell , is this a father &amp; son act .
we may never know what the irs was up too .
tell him the american people are with him
if obama was assad , obama would just say .
uh , he voted for obama .
nice try bob .
he wants to take over the country with his scumbag republican party .
a moderate but conservative republican .
5 libtards vs. 1 conservative , even odds .
impeach him before he destroys what we have left of america ! !
please , sir , put america first
you sir are finished in the republican party , please turn in your badge !
it can &apos;t stand the weight of obamacare .

he thinks we dont know this !
congratulations , tom .
i agree for james lankford for president .
mia , you need to support mr. citizens for trump
the illegal legacy of republican george bush and the traitorous republican congress continues .
of course bush has been orchestrating this whole debacle as an arm chair president !
defund it , delay it , repeal it !
hi , rand .
we don &apos;t want obamacare , it will degrade us all .
spot on comments sir .
how did senator tim scott vote ? ?
keep up the great work sen paul ! !
true americans will never give up !
i &apos;m so disappointed that you voted yes on betsy devos .
john c. every conservative says they are the only holy party in existence !
he did not listen to his constituants .
i think ryan should step down .
they all need to be right there until they are tried by the military !
in that case give up your government insurance you big taker of government programs .
i know emily cain .
an congress doesn &apos;t do anything to stop him .
i also stand with israel !

tn demonrat party must be manned by 12 year olds .
happy easter rep. gowdy !
arm rebels , so they can harm us , no way
the american people made a mistake when they didn &apos;t nominate john mccain .
so was the epa and osha .
you , mr. mcclintock among other republicans voted to fund obamacare ... why ?
tom , the clueless will almost always stay in that perpetual state .
tim scott &apos;s compensation .
no reforms .
look at dr tom price &apos;s proposal or other republican plans .
i bet you wont answer yes or no .
maybe obama will shakedown the border guards and convince them to let you in !
this is a great time for the republican party .
i appreciate all you are doing along with paul and cruz .
and our wh is taken over by them and we settle for it .
repeal not overhaul .
little by little this president is hacking away at our constitutional rights .
working to help pay for obama care
vern is part of the solution .
conservatives have ideas &amp; thoughts .
but prayers for you and your success !
starting to sound like this goes past contempt and into impeachment territory .
i read the president will veto .
first securing the border and fortifying it .
so am i mia but never just .
merry christmas senator tim scott and to your family !
when is the supreme court going to take away his veto power .
i stand with roy blunt .
your thoughts and prayers are no longer enough greg .
i love you trey gowdy ! ! ! !
good job mr. mccain .
you &amp; cruz need to band together or be left out .
and congrats sir
rand paul 2016 or sooner
senator graham , i respect you and your intelligence .
they should read the constitution while sitting there .
repeal obamacare and replace it ! !
lynn sorry stupid smart phone
i agree with the &quot; no fly list &quot; in theory .
may god bless you and the rest people try to make law ! ! !
of course he should pay taxes on free money .
goes to show how well loved mccain is , aye ?
i agree , clean house mr .
2016 president ( rand ) paul !
plus billion &apos;s of our tax dollar &apos;s !
we need a president not a socialist dictator .
i just cant say enough good things about rubio for senate seat !
pork and more pork .
ted cruz and diane black have fed health care .
we do not support devos who is fundamentally unqualified to do the job .
christie is a turn coat and no good either .
it needs to remain open &amp; why not send obama there !
obuma and holder are the traitors when are they going to impeach them
the only thing the current potus has in mind is the destruction of america .
please keep up the good fight mia love !
rubio you should know better .
keep it up marco !
i truly wish we had more politicians like you , trey gowdy .
and no i do not support clinton .
mr mccain , your country needs you now more than ever .
why don &apos;t you impeach him
god bless you and your family as we all pray for your miracle .
and if you think snowden is right .
blessed by you sir .
true , scott .
south carolina for trump !
cut all foreign aid across the board .
heaven spare us from any future such &quot; victories &quot; for mr. boehner .
absolutely not interested .
impeach him out of office with all of those that he hired !
if not how can you say tax has already been paid ?
tim , go trey gowdy on them !
you did vote for cloture , knowing that he would then be confirmed .
jeremi hayes
praying for all of us .
no more bs .. impeach him now or we will impeach congress !
senator mccain , i agree with previous comments .
glad you are there for us rand !
so , no i am not in obama &apos;s fantasmical 80 % .
no cap and trade , no over spending , immigration reform .
why doesn &apos;t anyone ever think of cutting the welfare rolls .
humble , texas was where god chose to show his power
we do not need rino charlie crist in office .
another good question from rand paul that we will never see answered by obama !
nothing less is treason to the constitution and tyranny of people .
ted cruz has call all the washington establishment .... corrupted . !
he is ruining the american family--the government goal .
hey johnny move to china !
close our eyes and put our fingers in our ears ?
have fun when you get a second obama term .
makes me feel good that mccain was playing poker while deciding my fate .
and that collapse is due to the president and his cronies .
very good to see the people of egypt stand up for their rights .
secure borders first .
lindsey israel-firster graham and john mcamnesty mccain are jokes .
i knew you were a clemson fan .
stop crying about emily and get on the trump train !
saying you are against obamacare is not enough !
obama can count hes not completely stupid why ?
yes sir i will !
luv ya mia !
tom mc clintock is not capable of this office .
you too , mr. mccain .
scott there has been a lot of misinformation on this bill .
get on board with the president &apos;s plan or get out of the way .
trey gowdy would be a breath of fresh air !
god &apos;s abundant blessings &amp; favor to you in jesus name ! ! ! !
the muslim brotherhood and all their minions .

i believe he is a hero not a traitor .
perfect the border .
so sorry you lost this wonderful teacher , trey gowdy .
what makes rand paul any different than any of other others ?
i bet we can find someone to replace you .
just like the irs did under obama ..... remember lois lerner .
god bless you all and your families ! ! !
rand paul for 2016. he gets it !
his impeachment is way overdue .
good on you sir .
trust will only be restored once we get back to respecting individual liberty .
under the circumstances , i think ryan did the best he could ! !
i hope you stand behind your party anything less would be a disgrace
we need ya b
mr. ryan , i am very upset with you .
trey gowdy ~ i hope you and your family had a blessed thanksgiving .
sue the irs ...
no more pork barrel until this country is out of debt .
please consider the libertarian party for your presidential vote .
what has to happen before this idiot ( obunghole ) gets impeached ?
you are so right tim !
someone needs to inform obama that he is not king
by appointing conservative judges to the supreme court .
you are delusional if you think betsy devos is competent for this position .
lower the debt ceiling better
there will be no default if a deal is not reached by tuesday .
at least dropping obama care !
all the revenue collected by the federal government .
god &apos;s blessings upon you , mia .
lord knows , florida needs some leadership .
doing a great job tim .
romney , ryan and rubio
you work for us and america doesn &apos;t want obamacare .
yes congressman gohmert you done all you could
tom , please make some sense and get back to us .
your a great american mia .
i appreciate our congressmen that have backbones .
i think that a big chunk of conservatives are livid with the republican party .
congratulations diane .
i &apos;m sure we are all praying for these people .
senator corker and senator alexander have lost my vote .
eric holder and the dept of just us certainly have no intentions !
we the people need to veto him out now .
paid by taxpayers money to fly around in air force one with traitor obama !
i see it as liberty v. tyranny .
get rid of ryan , btw .
lincoln reagan washington and anyone but carter or obummer
you &apos;re embarrassing yourself coffman .
time for congressional term limits is obvious here !
why are you posting this marsha ?
please help stop obama from damaging this country more .
if rand wins the nomination i will once again vote democrat .
i hope u get a new yoho 4 xmas
get him out of office , hes gonna kill america , obama hates us !
christie is an azz and a traitor to his party
close the border yesterday ! ! ! ! !
then when the truth come out it is too late .
the question remains , will a republican president do something about it ?
rand paul , the murderer fidel &apos;s replacement for che guevara .
thanky ou sir
why hasn &apos;t eric holder investigated the idiot in the white house ?
should not listen to him .
don all you can to get that idiot in the white house impeached
&lt; 3 &lt; 3 trey gowdy for president 2020 &lt; 3 &lt; 3
he needs to be impeached and his cronies tossed in jail .
us senator tim scott .
i did the only thing i could do down here in georgia .
immigration on the border and syrian migrants are similar .
the ga constitution has no mention of militia .
likewise , mr. gowdy : )
anybody see this on fox today ?
boehner is dead wood .
enforce the u.s. constitution as it is our basic law .
with you all the way mr paul .
lou you have been infected with the disease of progressivism .
thanks mia .
over ride it obama a pos he belongs in prison
stop almost all foriegn aid .
arming egypt now today .
merry christmas üéÑ to you and your family mr. senator trey howdy .
where were you months ago .
ooooo ..... i bet ole scott was wringing his hands when he wrote this ...
option b. transit , ho !
congress needs jeh johnson to testify regarding the abysmal failure of dhs .
lets see if our supreme court justices can actually follow the constitution .
he is a rino at best .
this president is not to be trusted .
senator corker , i live and vote in johnson city , tn .
if not then someway to put on duty law or military in the schools .
we need to rein in the spending .
happy independence day to congressman harper &amp; family
u can &apos;t impeach a president , when both sides r just as corrupt .
are you saying obama didn &apos;t bring us back from the brink ?
mccain is on the wrong side of this .
the treasury is part of both the irs and the delphi scandals .
this administration has no creditable leg to stand on for us to believe them .
woke-up god bless america !
you must run for speaker !
good work lindsey !
obama now has my vote as your side gets nothing done .
obama should pull in his lower lip and come to the table !
no amnesty for immigrants .
unconstitutional does not bother obama .
my wife and i voted for dave earlier today .
conservatives should not be appearing on msnbc .
thanks bruce keep up the good work wish there were more like you in congress
you work for us , not betsy devos .
there is no compromise when it comes to violating the constitution .
no amnesty , and no obamacare ... and no obama !
stay strong in your convictions and principles .
you &apos;ve got nothing to replace it with .
i listened to the lame speech pres o gave this afternoon .
the guy who called you a wacko bird is a dodo bird .
watched you senator standing up for our military .
he is chaos just like jeb bush said .
they got to comey again ! !
obama pays them well with our money !
after this ..... holder isn &apos;t going any where obama is circling the wagons
that &apos;s the marco rubio we all know and love .
force john boehner to resign - today !
merry christmas mr gowdy and a happy new year .
plz tell me marsha did not cosponsor this act .... plz !
called rep. kerry bentivolio 11th district and his office says he is voting no .
he probably almost shook boehner out of his rear end from laughing so hard .
their goal is to destroy the federal government .
welcome to the rino club kristi---it didn &apos;t take you long ! !
you , lindsey graham and mitt romney have see the hysterics of donald trump .
reagan was a bumbling fool .
vote for peace ... no war against syria ... no war ... vote no
the flag should stay
i am with you tom , people forget what patriots are .
the president needs to step down and out of the white house
most of all run opposing obamacare .
every morning our children pledge allegiance to the flag and to this country .
congress needs to put some restraints on his budget .
no recess apointment .
no he didn &apos;t say that .
obama wants them all to the citizens at our expense cutting our benefits .
john mccain , we need some principled republican congressmen to stand up to trump .
you said it yourself , &quot; if impeachment were viable &quot; .
in the end , it is no compromise .
raising taxes - for anyone , is complete insanity .
praying for paris and the entire world
god bless his heart !
votes to repeal &quot; obamacare . &quot;
this president is determined to destroy our country .
being a fiscal conservative does not mean you have to want a weak america .
dr. paul should have been president .
have a backbone for once and stand up to obama
open letter reply to mr. sasse .
you &apos;re just jealous of mia , trying to steal her thunder .
what do u think a paul - carson ticket for 2016
i &apos;m dissapointed in you also mr. rand paul .
it &apos;s too late for you to get on board the # trumptrain traitor !
the point is to hold the line and stand on our principles .
no kidding ........
obama needs to resign .
hold the line sir
there are so many lost people who need the lord !
obama needs to be sitting next to morsi with his bother ...
impeachment should be in the immediate future ...
conservatives being conservative ...
right on , but the media does not want to point that out .
honorable sir , time for talk is over , let &apos;s see action !
mrs. devos does not appear to understand even the basics of educational law !
apparently palazzo hasn &apos;t read the constitution .
john mccain has lost touch with what america is all about !
prayers for our country blame now will not help us
we need unity mr. speaker .
you have my vote mr. poliquin
obama will negotiate with terrorist but not republicans
thanks from tennessee , home of senator bob corker and gov .
people are losing their jobs today because of obamacare .
i can tell you sir , i will not obey the obamacare mandate .
agreed congressman bob goodlatte !
president obama is a habitual liar and has been from &quot; day one &quot; .
how is this not treason and why is no one arresting him ?
he wants people dependent on the government .
senator isakson - i am a georgia resident living in smyrna .
start packing your bags paul ryan .
the children of tennessee need you to vote no .
lawless administration subverting the rule of law demands impeachment and defunding .
we need god back in schools homes and especially in government .
i &apos;m voting for jonny isakson and jody hice and ms clinton .
this judge must think he is obama , the dictator .
an endorsement by rino john mccain , ....... a kiss of death ?
i sure respect you , mr. gowdy !
2016 president marco rubio !
this administration has been abusing power and needs to be held accountable
do something --say something marco .
ron paul = end of civilization
obama is only for himself .
ohh hell no !
he needs to disclose his tax returns .
please run against lindsey graham for the senate
wish you would have done this earlier but better late than never .
writing in cruz !
senator , you &apos;re embarrassing yourself by being so blatantly wrong about obamacare .
it is treasonous the way some members of our government are acting !
i see a bright , bright future for you mia .
god bless you mia ! ! ! ! ! !
no wonder we are in debt !
end all foreign aid !
rooting for you in november , mia !
and you are not a traitor , fight the good fight dr. senator rand .
your links are just plan idiotic as are your positions .
period sir !
only to end o care is to vote out all dems .
happy thanksgiving trey gowdy god bless you we love you ....
i think a , since the obama gang has taken the jobs away .
welcome to facebook , dave .
here &apos;s to you not being re-elected in sc .
our prayers are with you .
i do not support the confirmation of ms. devos .
i wish i could vote for you but i do not live in utah .
no taxation without representation , do we remember those words ?
no wmd ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
mia , your comments all correct .
mr mcclintock i am a conservative .
please , please listen to your constituents in wyoming , not these ill-informed liberals .
totally agree but it is a total shame the liberal media spinning it incorrectly .
amen where is it going to end !
you just convinced me even more to oppose spending .
we are the idiots for letting him get away with this .
# standwithrand in 2016 !
what a gigantic mess congress has gotten us in .
and be exempt from obamacare
i respectfully disagree , sir .
happy new year mia .
fund the government and defund obamacare ! ! !
there no better them me except there pay .
you rock on marco .
please reconsider changing your vote to no .
can you help florida be blessed with constitutional carry sir ?
it &apos;s not even a fair debate .
he lied about the cost of obamacare .
you are a true american hero , god bless !
it was a military attack , it needed congress approval .
you are a conservative .
the republicans need to clean house if you want them to hear you .
and yes sen paul we are in your state !
sir , this is off subject but we want to see it come true .
when are you running for president mr .
oklahoma for donald trump 2016 , this group is open for business come join .
why doesn &apos;t someone stand up to them .
pass the zadroga bill giving the first responders what they deserve !
you were elected to represent the state of tn and we have spoken .
the only difference between mccain and obama is obama admits he is a democrat .
other presidents have pulled us out of recessions and problems .
can you mr roy help with immigration reform
i think it &apos;s time for the president to resign in disgrace .
you were part of the failed gop during obama &apos;s fiasco .
i &apos;m horrified by your decision to abandon south carolina students - again .
god bless you bill .
thanks trey for saying it like it really is ! !
i believe that trump will be the republican nomination instead of mr cruz .
then they will try and kill our military with that equipment .
you have no spine you chickenshit bastard !
whats your end game mr paul ryan ?
happy birthday jesus and merry christmas to you marsha .
how is congress getting away with this ....
sounds like someone reinstated the patriot act without telling anybody
get isis leader out of our oval office !
2 ) stop all pork barrel spending .
just would like to say , john mccain .
or shall we wait until it is too late to stop the bureaucrats ?
also of failed status quo republican policies .
i resign would be what i want to hear most .
watch they will keep on kill kill kill people &apos;s remove flag won &apos;t work
that was a bigger blow to our constitution than anything obama has done .
they cut his dad out of debate once .
a republican whining about someone thinking they &apos;re above the law .
have a safe easter
no , we are counting on congress to hold obama accountable ! ! !
keep &quot; getting it right &quot; , mia ! !
please remember liberty always !
senator , we are tired of losing sir .
tell it like it is mr .
rubio 2020
ryan , you don &apos;t mean what you say .
something could &apos;ve been done for benghazi .
especially if they are going along with obama and his crap !
did we not learn anything from the obamacare debacle ?
you are an enemy now .
it was bush that created the mess in the middle east .
fire the whole bunch at election time !
would love to think this would stop the jets from going to egypt .
john a. boehner , the hon .
well just raise the debt ceiling and it will be someone else &apos;s problem !
flush congress &amp; start over .
have some guts to do what &apos;s right instead of towing the party line .
he shld be speaking for himself , marco for president
vote out the ones responsible in 2014
congressman bruce poloquin and the house will do the right thing .
nuts to impeachment ... arrest for treason
you should have stood with rand paul !
you obviously do not listen to your constituents .
my prayers for them ! !
vote no tpa
and any feds that get in the way .
looking forward to your retirement mr. mcconnell .
you are as big of a whiner as ted cruz and idiot rubio .
amanda - add the rinos to that problem list .
chris christie is afraid of obama .
unfortunately the administration is untouchable
sanford was awesome !
i am disappointd in you and tim scott .
they are again wasting our money .
it is way past time to begin the impeachment of hussein !
mr. desjarlais , what are our representatives going to do to stop this ?
the very reason illegals come to this country for .
we know you don &apos;t actually know or care about mandela sir .
i am part of the wacko bird flock then ! ! !
including rand paul .
enforce immigration law now &gt; &gt; &gt;
hey rand , why don &apos;t you take a poll ?
my contempt for graham and mccain is beyond containment .
quit talking about it and do something !
here is another politicization of terrorist by obama .
the patriotic american people love you , trey gowdy ! !

i liked ted cruz , ben carson and carly fiorina best .
that &apos;s a nice way of putting it , marco .
now our country is left with this huge debt .
he is what america needs to turn our economy and jobs situation around .
families across our state urged you to vote no to betsy devos .
as a socialist i would like to ask what are your ideas or proposals ?
limiting the ability of the president to push his agenda through using executive powers
way more honorable than ted cruz .
if you think obamacare will be less costly are you in for a surprise .
harry reid doesn &apos;t get nearly as much attention as he should .
i so agree with securing the borders .
your constituents in tn include all of us !
i say vote no ! !
praying for the miracle that only god can do .
boehner and mcconnell absolutely must go !
so james lankford we elected you and we expect you to take action .
among present house members , trey gowdy .
pandering to the left again rand ?
the epa has grown too powerful and is overstepping their bounds .
people like you are why republicans have supported donald trump from the beginning .
greg walden is an idiot .
he just violated the constitution - yet again .
i am thankful for your honorable service to this country rep. gowdy god bless
the president has followed all the rules and protocol to put this before .
enjoy your day sir !
truly demonstrated how cowardly obama and holder really are .
what &apos;s happens to is govt employees by attaching the obamacare to the cr vote
save the second amendment and impeach obama .
that question is too logical for a demonrat to understand , tom mcclintock !
blame the patriot act - and then get rid of it !
the officer has been charged for what he did .
what the hell happened to you , mr .
the democratics will never quit spending .
cruz , rubio and fiorina impressed .
amen mr scott .
no not sorry i missed it either .
fox is biased ? ? ? ?
may god bless you john mccain .

it only takes two congressmen to file impeachment proceedings i &apos;ve been told .
prayers and more prayers are needed for the parents who have forever been affected .
don &apos;t let us down rand paul !
saw you on fox today .
get on the stick man !
boehner just knows how to kick the can down the road .
you have done a huge disservice to the children in north carolina .
your a winner marco !
the bill was introduced by dennis and paul .
liberty is just starting to make a big come back

impeachment , impeachment , to save america
welcome home , sir .
and soon the dhs ss will round u up and put u into fema camps
he got his orders from haley barbour and did as he was told .
senator love , we all know that obama is a law breaker .
i assume you are talking to me dave .
if he signs an executive order it will all be on him .
the epa has too much authority already ...
obama is a piece of camel feces !
you &apos;ve had 7 years to come up with a replacement plan .
trey gowdy , you have my respect and trust !
mr. moran has iran invaded us ?
i &apos;m a cuban american and a veteran you promised to support the nominee .

your stand on illegals is also an embarrassment .... retire old man !
we should cut all ties with them .
wow , marsha blackburn is just a tool for big oil .
ted cruz was left twisting in the wind ! ! !
happy easter lynn .
ted cruz annoys the establishment republicans because he actually votes the way he speaks .
absolutely 100 % agree .
the boehner plan never balances , ever .
well y &apos;all sure didnt care about benghazi .
congress needs single item legislation like oklahoma has !
why dont we try and balance the budget .
i am watching you speak -- go representative lankford !
bless you ; trey gowdy .
rather than conservative , i &apos;m libertarian .
electing communists to office , and appointing communist judges
we know that , now do something about it .
let &apos;s deport tom rice ! ! !
god &apos;s speed lou !
at least he is standing up for the american people .
liberal symbolism - the flag is construed as a &quot; symbol of hate &quot; .
did he forget senator barrasso in this list ?
do not let obamacare be funded ! ! !
israel is our only ally over there .
border patrol should be considered an essential government service .
go play poker .
i oppose devos .
you , sir , are no patriot and no christian .
i &apos;m a teacher at a rural south carolina high school .
why no one challenges obama is beyond everyone
more waste of time from the gop .
the economy is in much better shape than when he took office .
i can &apos;t believe our govt .
keep our ins .
republicans want the government shutdown not obama .
james , you &apos;re doing a good job .
you are all so very blessed to have rand paul as your senator .
the national debt issue was caused by ur republican predecessors .
either way the irs has too much power over who gets shafted .

so sad .. god bless his family and comfort them , in jesus name ..
and like obamacare
our nation needs the prayers .
you guys didn &apos;t stop amnesty .
when are you going to start impeachment proceedings agains obama ?
we have enough idiots in the government trying to ruin this country .
a house member votes on bills coming back from the senate n committee .
the tone of the republican party is of this congressman .
amen and god bless thm all and their families
we must cut spending ! !
well said , mike .
i oppose betsy devos because she has no experience in public education .
we all cheered his opposition to obamacare .

i &apos;m very worried about holder getting his hands on the november election .
rand paul is the strongest conservative running .
i think we have broken people in the o admin trying to run it .
jonathan , spoken like a true narrow minded conservative .
if only you could have fought this hard to defund planned parenthood .
god bless you and your service the the people of the usa .

but if he looses it is his own fault not paul ryan &apos;s .
i don &apos;t want apology , i want change in the tax code .
if you want another democrat as president , then you vote for ted cruz .
our current administration has only approved 32 leasing requests , 32 !
the against was speaker ryan , who was one of the main conspirators .

no one should give our leadership a free pass if they drag this out .
he has no intention of protecting our constitutional rights .

go after trump marco !
may god bless you and through him he can make all things new .
vern , i just read your pole and voted undecided .

please reconsider supporting this out of touch and unqualified candidate .
and , mike , you should have left that last sentence out .

too bad we can &apos;t impeach supreme court justices !
obama should sit down and talk with terrorist leaders like he said he would lol
spot on paul !
that video clip was fantastic rand
everyone inherits the first 5.4 million tax free .
obama is commited to leading us to a socialist welfare state .
he has divided our country , we need a leader
reduce the military spending and quit blaming the poor for all our troubles .
yet all these senators and congressman are exempt from obamacare .
also praying for missing
conservatives need some backbone !
may god bless you for protecting those who cannot protect themselves !
cuba , south america , africa ... there is where true poverty exists .

can we the people start a petition to start impeachment .
hey cathy , why are you purging the house committees of real conservative voices ?
he is a christian man strong in his faith .
i have no confidence in the senate and congress .
no refugees , close borders .
odumma has done all he could to destroy america .
rand paul hands down
clemson is playing teams that are easy to win !

ron he &apos;s better than that lying idiot in the wh
obama is saying &quot; we will trust you .
god bless u , and know that jesus is in control .
impeaching obama to save america .
obama needs to get out of our lives .
the present administration only needs to enforce them .
congress needs to keep him from getting further out of control .
let the people of sc vote on whether it should stay or go .
impeach obama for benghazi !
im standing in prayer for you and your family .
he could win the election with ben carson as his vp
republican repeal plan adds $ 9 trillion to the national debt .

mccain need to be in a retirement home .
you sir , are a traitor and that is probably being nice .
mia love for president ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
obama is a tool , liar , and a fraud .
please , fire boehner !
impeaching him will not remove him from office .
there was no win for anyone in voting yes on this tax bill .
ground the air force one .
repeal this dispicable gpo / wep act signed by ronald reagan ...... hurting retirees !
what gets me is congress doesn &apos;t have the cahons to override it .
to the msm he can do no wrong .
is our senate ever going to do anything ? ? ? ?
have you actually read the agreement yet , congressman ?
either way he still bears the responsibility under his watch .
mr gowdy is the right man for speak ...
all obama wants to do is spend .
you have our trust and admiration mr. trey gowdy !
it &apos;s the people versus the establishment republican or democrat .
president obama needs to wake up .
this should teach everyone to save for times when they have no job .
let &apos;s all vote for rubio !
wacko birds !
that &apos;s a big , hell no !
bush lied about wmd and he is the good guy ?
do not repeal the a.c.a.
it seems the government couldn &apos;t care less for the american people .
your tactics border on treason .
johnny please do something .
no , they will blame president bush .
in that respect , rand paul stands a head above ....
where have you been all this time , paul ?
but they can &apos;t do a impeachment for oblama .
you have earned this mike .
the representative house needs to actually protect the constitution and impeach obama .
how dare you support obamacare .
the patriot act was and is unconstitutional ; quit treating your constituents like criminals .
( wasn &apos;t it ronald reagan who said &quot; trust but verify &quot; ) .
rubio is an idiot !
they well never vote to reduce spending .
mccain needs to stop slumming with a piece of drecch like you .
he seems to despise the american military !
as a navy vet i am ashamed of you mr. mccain .
please make fireworks illigal before it is too late
common sense has left this country and the devil is running the white house .
i pray that you would do something to help the people of your district !
god &apos;s richest blessings on you .
this makes no sense , why do republicans have to pay more taxes ? ?
i vote for trey gowdy !
no cuba
go back in your cave and wash your loincloth .
he needs to be impeached and in jail end of story .
gabe rozeman brandon crowfeather hubbard dylan good on mccain
i would have been tickled pink if the dhs ran out of money .
mccain runs as a conservative to get elected then reverts to deserting conservative principles .
history will repeat itself.erica lee is a liberal.if in doubt , attack.love the media .
you are elected to protect the constitution and do the will of the people .
more to do about obamacare !
poe is lying to you.poe voted to bring the bill to the floor .
you control the purse .
you are bought and paid for by devos .
but , you had nothing to say about that traitor !
i &apos;m a georgia voter who supports energy independence .
we must demand defund now !
i will pray for your precious baby and you and your husband .
i hate everything this administration is doing to this country .
you &apos;re doing it right , rand ! ! !
there &apos;s a socialist behind every tree .
fox is a sellout !
liberals and rinos spent it on crony pet projects .
john mccain is one of the remaining good ones in the republican party .
mr. lankford you will have my vote in the primary .
i hope you stand up to this tyrant !
i have no sons ... thank god !
time to stand up mia .
and what is congress going to do about it ? ? ? ? ?
congressman blackburn , surely you can understand that .
the only thing they did is decrease spending growth .
christie , mccain , mcconnell , and even boehner are all traitors .
trey had a great mentor
ground for impeachment .
running our country .the debt .
senator mccain , you are an american hero and we love you .
we need to stop socialism ! ! ! ! ! ! !
tell that to boehner and mcconnell !
you dropped the ball paul
they should have read the oath to uphold the constitution all together .
mitch mcconnell !
so when are you defunding obama care ?
remember sir you work for us &quot; we the people &quot; .
this was a letter from bo himself about transparency and open govt .
not just no but h # # no !
both boehner and mcconnell need to be replaced .
what do you suggest we cut spending on kristi ?
impeach the mo-fo .
hell yeah , rand paul !
he is trampling on our constitution and taking away our freedoms one by one .
the man is a traitor to this country .
looks like there &apos;s a gowdy fan club .
merry christmas trey to you and your family and a very happy new year .
go johnny , go !
thank-you , james !
you are already slipping conservative ideology in .
happy new year bruce cheers to more prosperous times in 2017 üéâ
trey keep their feet in the fire !
you dare to call yourself a conservative reformer ? ?
would have been nice to have rand or cruz at our back !
i urge you to support the &quot; no budget , no pay &quot; idea .
dump obama and his cronies and obamacare now ! !
vote &quot; no &quot; on disaster relief funds that contain non-related pork .
man , i thought he quit smoking dope ... apparently not .
no , no and no ! ! ! ! !
marco rubio is the answer for the senate
a flat tax is not a fair tax .
patrick tiberi is a traitor and an enemy of the people !
oklahomans will work diligently to defeat you and lankford for this vote .
you , mr. ryan , are the exact reason most people hate politics .
meen while obummer plays another round of golf .
remind mitch about the &quot; simple majority rule &quot; .
mcclintock for president !
the only way to stop him is to impeach him .
great speech tonight , marco !
marco most missed days in senate ....
exactly what do u mean tom ?
that would force immediate spending cuts .
sir , she is grossly uninformed and unqualified for this position .
time vote out the rinos &amp; moderates &amp; get the conservatives in office .
sure seems like a lot of non ky folks .
john mccain you &apos;re maniacal wimp .
boehner is a rino .... goehmert should have been elected speaker ....
i would vote for you if i could sir ! !
funny i thought mainers elected bruce not israelies .
lindsey handles things in sc so good !
and obama &apos;s not a muslim , but i wish he was .
recently met with the muslim brotherhood and no media was allowed .
remind them that conservatives are watching their every move .
if your fellow republicans acted like this i would switch parties .
that was part of obama &apos;s plan .
what are you congressmen going to do about it ?
tom mcclintock , 3 cheers , to the smartest man in the room !
mr. gowdy , you sir are an inspiration !
especially securing our borders
said it before and will say it again , term limits
maybe you should have done your job , then gone on vacation .
emily elana adrianna pulford
what happened overnight that changed your mind mr lankford ?
it &apos;s time to audit the fed !
go mr. mcclintock !
washington needs to get out of our schools .
let &apos;s pray to god not !
vote no on devos and uphold our public system of education .
carly florina was the leader as i see it .
i admire you trey gowdy .
we need border patrol heavily armed ... not ebola
sit down jerry .
reid is a complete fool .
he might just be setting himself up for impeachment .
that would cut government spending in half and increase income at the same time .
wright , how do you know thom tillis scrubbed those post ?
our republic is over , theconstitution is not the law of the land .
meehan makes traitors list . &quot;
thats a metaphor not a racial comnet sir .
keep religion out of politics , go rand
i don &apos;t think obama wants to avoid the cliff .
put some tanks out there and just stop them
they were defenders of liberty which father and son paul are today .
sure hope trey run after trump
thank god we have obama as the president of the united states !
a vote for romney is a vote for obama .
he is breaking his oath of office .
i say repeal it !
thanks for standing up to obamas lawlessness .
and to vote no
your true colors came through bob .
lindsey you are worthless
senator ted cruz presented the constitutional vision at hillsdale college last saturday .
i wil support you as long as you do not cave to the liberals .
don &apos;t let our defenses down because obama wants this .
the use or lose end of fiscal year monies needs to be seriously addressed !
you would think they would call us when problems arise , but no ! !
rand , you are my rep. best vote ever !
go rand , go.i &apos;m all for you .
praying for her full and speedy recovery !
so of course he vetoed the ksp .
no to syria and no to obamacare !
free mason ted cruz directly connected to aztlan / mexico .
obama heads the muslim brotherhood , he has others as his closest advisors .
lindsey get busy confirming cabinet .
support flat tax .
bruce is the only representation we have in washington .
as well republican party !
she is totally unqualified .
like ryan has any credibility .
praying for you , james !
but stupid is so rampant that surmounting it may be our down fall
when will congress have term limits ?
who have the principles of god faith intentions .
great quote rand paul !
we need a lot more politicians doing what is right for the american people .
no one in the republican party respects you .
impeachment is a good title , but doesnt do anything .
there was a time i had great respect for you , senator mccain .
i am outraged that you would confirm devos .
praying you will win next time so we can get the socialist out of office
but , whatever the outcome john boehner needs to be removed as speaker !
sounds like his 96 colleagues might just need to push forward for impeachment !
praying for you and all mr. scott stand firm .
do not repeal obamax care ... fix it ! !
it is past time we the people got educated and took our country back .
we are 100 % behind you tim scott .
rand paul what do you support ?
your sc constituents deserve better .
need more tom mc clintocks higher up in the political chain ! !
he will not follow the constitution .
they are ruining our country !
you got that exactly right scott , thanks for not bending ... oh !
get well soon mr b !
dear representative lankford , what do you personally think of john mccain ?
my husband lost his it job six months ago .
go git em louie !
i can &apos;t believe the people who do believe obama &amp; are blind followers .
i am praying for the decisions that have to be made .
shame on lamar for selling his soul .....
lord we ask you to once again take leadership of this once great nation !
john mccain must go ! ! !
finally a republican pushing back never give g-mo away either ! !
and obama stopped that ?
trey you are our hope our trooper in the trenches .
well done , mr .
ronald reagan they ain &apos;t ... too bad , too !
if he does not get the nomination , he will run as an independent .
why is eric holder still serving as attorney general ?
yes we all agree
never thought you of all people would become a rino !
i get that you want conservative principles .
senator jerry moran , i am disappointed in you .
but what will the majority gop in congress and senate do about it ?
yes , the desert wacko bird spoke .
so tom , what the heck are you gonna do about it ?
lindsey , please vote against that insane &apos; shot across the bow &apos; !
johnny , can conservatives use their heads ?
keep up the good work sen. flake .
is there a possibility for 2016 rubio all the way ! !
the only way to protect america from putin is to impeach trump .
add to that obamacare which has 21 new taxes on americans .
austin scott is a lost cause and we all know it .
senator sasse , thanks very much for your letter .
i &apos;m white mr mccain and i live in ohio .
not betsy devos
republicans now in the majority can &apos;t get anything done .
sc will surely miss you .
vote johnny out !
we are in big trouble with obamacare .
you &apos;re a little late to the game .
don &apos;t let that dictator we call president get his way .
the fbi has declared a candidate for potus careless and negligent .
should let the folks vote on impeaching him !
shame on you marco rubio .
the first nominee for president under fbi investigation .
then start moving toward impeachment !
oppose cloture &amp; support the house in working to defund obamacare .
96 % of the epa employees were furloughed because they are non-essential .
that &apos;s not how our government sees it .
betsy devos and her family &apos;s money are not the answer .
right now the government is controlled by people with no regard for the country .
do something about their &apos; training camps &apos; here in tennessee now !
no one has been fired .
he wants it both ways .
i live in florida and you sir will not be getting my vote !
as for speaker .
about time senator mccain .
obama wants to fly somewhere on america &apos;s dime , not happening .
keep ranting rand , we stand with you !
eagerly awaiting the articles of impeachment , tom .
exactly right , marsha blackburn .
impeach revoked prosecute now congress house and senate !
stand strong ; stand on the foundation of truth , mr. gowdy .
rand , i hope it backfires big time on you !
why didn &apos;t you vote on merrick garland ?
back up cruz ! ! !
why not fair tax ?
congresswoman blackburn knows this !
did you win sir ?
‚Äï ronald reagan
that is why we still have obamacare - because they will not defund it !
i still think mr scalia was murdered .
how can we change leaders speaker baighner needs to go
this is why fixing the illegal immigration problem is easy .
do not give in on obamacare that no one wants .
he would oppose it to try to save his hide .
they agreed to fund the aca if they get the delay .
democrats looked like a bunch of terrorists in trying to outlaw the us constitution !
i sincerely hope you will reconsider this decision .
praying for the christian men who are actually acting like a christian !
senator mccain , i agree .
he is acting like a tyrant and traitor !
he is a man of character and he is a constitutionist and fiscal conservative .
god continually bless you !
greg - the american people need to help themselves get back to work .
senator mccain please put america üá∫ üá∏ first over party affiliation .
we are begging you and the republican leadership to stand up .
i believe that an example of this is the obamacare tax .
yes ... too late lindsey .
my pitch is for mitch !
the president has been willing to compromise .
i heart rand .
( a ) raise taxes = no bush cuts for anyone = 360b .
mccain quit bothering people with your senile comments .
praying for a win , mr sanford !
border security is a separate and distinct issue from immigration .
cut wasteful spending ?
which is ok if this was a socialist or commnist country .
no , on both counts greg .
you &apos;re a class act mr. scott !
lindsey is doing too little too late.he needs to get voted out .
god bless you too üôè üèª ‚ù§ Ô∏è
shouldn &apos;t everyone in congress try to reduce or shrink government authority .
we need help sir !
2 days before the election he &apos;s just trying to cover his butt .
thanks for defending our conservative position .
glad to hear he is ok. praying for a full recovery !
thanks senator thune for all you do for us !
isn &apos;t there anyone in this country who can stand up to obama ?
3. america , with the help of the hurst news owner invaded cuba .
get rid of rino &apos;s
let obama his family and his administration have it !
boehner had plenty of opportunity but chose to betray conservatives .
everything this president does is shouted down by the gop .
you tell &apos; em , mia !
it does not involve holding up a spending bill .
i &apos;ve been telling my friends and family about you rand !
james marshall what makes you an expert ?
no answers of benghazi yet .
if i were harry reid , i say it has a fact !
flat tax 6 %
i sure hope that nc gov .
doesn &apos;t say anything about conservatives getting targeted though .
i don &apos;t believe y &apos;all should be getting paid right now .
same to you and your family , vern !
no , the scotus restored the constitution
so you and your conservative cronies will be adopting all the unwanted babies .
he needs to be out of office .
when you welcome the enemy within your borders , he will kill you .
but we also need to stop sending money and planes etc .
i lost a lot of respect for you mr. ryan
mike , clearly you are an authority on shooting blanks .
i salute you ; now , remove that confederate flag from state grounds
the party of the jellyfish caved again to the left .
fair tax not flat tax !
you have made us sc people proud
that is why you are seeing chaos : because this was not conservative .
way to tell them today on meet the depressed senator scott !
mia love , it is your wisdom that got you elected ! !
senator moran , i am in your camp .
sasse is another puppet not wanting to stop the corruption that is going on .
you &apos;re making lots of sense mr. mcclintock .
what &apos;s scarry is the irs scandal was intentionally leaked .
now , the liberty movement will go on without me ?
lindsey graham is a coward .
yes president bush added to the debt .
we got your back down here in texas !
as for how much tax is enough 1000 tax credit per child is unfair .
hooray for you congressman scott desjarlais !
you &apos;ve done a disservice to the children of sc .
obama should be impeached and imprisoned .
how embarrassing for marsha .
rino turncoat .
i sent emails .
they are ruining our schools as we speak .
but one who is a true christian does not persist or live in sin .
lindsey would have us covered up w / wet backs .
he &apos;s already broken the law and the constitution .
gather support among your peers and defund obamacare .
impeach him please
where &apos;s the 2 / 3 override at ?
no wonder everyone hates us .
its a load of crap bob .
the obama nation is an abomination !
a - stop the federal government spending .
any &quot; no pay &quot; provision violates the 27th amendment to the u.s. constitution .
how about we enforce the laws that already exist ?
beautiful words senator scott .
good idea , sir .
obamas on his next project immigration reform
facebook and fox
the president hasn &apos;t divided this country .
why weren &apos;t you standing strong with senators cruz and lee ?
mr lankford , why have you not taken a stand against mr. trump ?
you deserve it senator paul .
no one is stopping obama .
the rebels are our enemy as well as assad .
lindsey , you are making a mistake !
both ted kennedy and george bush came up with nclb .
it &apos;s an embarrassment to the republican party .
christie is worse then rubio .
way to be a leader there greg .
facebook i think would fall more under rules pertaining to political campaigning .
obama is aiding and abetting terrorism !
when &apos;s the last time there has been a clean cr
yes jerry .
a little too late for you to say anything paul .
maybe mr gowdy you should do something about it then .
get well johnny !
just keep telling yourself that , ted .
check the statistics from reagan &apos;s congressionally-approved amnesty package .
why is obama allowed to lie again &amp; again to the american people .
god bless you trey gowdyand god bless america
you were elected to represent us , the people of south carolina !
god speed and bless !
the american people chose him for your party .
obama needs to be arrested .
so , get rid of common core .
senators that voted for obamacare are up for reelection in 2012
praying .
i cannot believe you voted yes on betsy devos .
i do not beleive the epa has served its purpose .
you &apos;re spineless and weak .
caleb smith all goverment leaches should take a pay cut not just a freeze

americans do not want amnesty .
praying for all those affected !
tim you need to take the reins in 8 yeats

his resignation would have been the best outcome of his speech .
the annual deficit is down to a third of what obama was left with .
prayers for wisdom and strength .
senator scott , you always make us so proud ! ! !
bringing in 3rd party is a vote for hillary .
to you too mike .
you are a rino and you should quit the senate now .
evict obama now !
rino ryan needs to go .
they will feel like prisoners in a strange land .
we cannot afford a republican president ever again .

i have been a conservative independent since i was old enough to vote .
be like trey gowdy &amp; never back down .
thanks scott , sure hope we can find more like you to help .
congressman gowdy , i am a frustrated veteran .
fk off lindsey

you &apos;re a fraud paul .
good ole bo administration at it &apos;s finest !
i am glad that i have senator cruz standing up for us .
i beg you to please vote no on cloture .
its time to give obama his walking papers ....
this should stand alone and not be coattailed on the cr .
i knew you were out there sen paul but i cannot agree with you .

the question is , when are you going to doing something about it ?
good for you ted ! !

obama wants to rewrite our constitution .
the libertarian way is a caring , people-centered approach to politics .
i pray that he will turn us away from wicked ways .

this is not conservative and not how the free market should work .
seriously tim .
less spending and lower taxes will the country growing again
so you spent , spent , spent ! ! ! !
this is outrageous that bho and his administration have gotten away with this .
a patriot .
he &apos;s a traitor to conservative values and he must go ! !
this proves obama and the democrats created and armned our enemies thereby committing treason .
i sent money to your campaign because you represented yourself as a conservative .
some of us aren &apos;t communist pieces of socialist shit ...
please help america john mccain
no bueno .
you have no idea how much harm repealing the aca will cause .
cloture seems to me to be in favor of obamacare
what and how do we have to do to get him impeached ?
how about kansas city ?
this is contrary to all the information about devos .
impeach the muslim terrorist .
now it &apos;s on american soil if isis can be believed .
i &apos;m very disappointed in your vote today for devos .
you are absolutely right , james .
so impeach him already ! !
then i guess i like &quot; wacko birds ! &quot;
people with pre-existing conditions cannot get health insurance .
you never stood up to obama .
downgraded is no better than degraded , sir .
take a stand to balance the budget .
obama is demonizing couples making over $ 250,000 .
let &apos;s see senator mccain voting to overturn this
but we definitely need to look at what we are handing over to egypt .
my question mr lankford is , &quot; what will you do about this ? &quot;
saving reagan is on the military channel
luck people living in a conservative utopia compared to ca .
now john mccain wants to displace them again .
i am imploring you to impeach obama now !
god bless and keep texas strong ! !
the real american patriots have had enough of the bs coming out of dc .
rand paul all the way ! ! ! !
do you really want to let obama do this on his authority ?
any strong constitutional conservative !
hope he follows the constitution .
paul the bottom half pay no income taxes .
and you have no vote for his replacement
you are an inspiration , dr .
i totally agree j sam miller .
michael , i do not believe it does enough to curb military spending .
hey rubio , stop crying &amp; support the peoples choice .
potus .. now we have a first rate cell available for you at gitmo
retool the irs to audit government programs and end the federal reserve
no money until border gets secure
betsy devos is in no way qualified .
it seems he will never stop hating this nation for the freedoms we have .
the atheist ayn rand or the poor loving jesus christ ?
please reconsider your support for devos and vote &quot; no &quot; .
say good bye to our rights under the constitution .
amen to that thought , tom !
benghazi and tax fraud by the irs .
i do t like this mess , but it &apos;s all on obamas watch .
that the freedom applies to all not just one group .
it is past time to impeach obama and get rid of obamacare !
forever , silencing many ancient christian sects .
hope its not all too little too late mr. ryan !
let &apos;s hold the house accountable for the spending
vern buchanan totals : 993,976.07
well said rand paul
obama says go forward then we will talk ..... don &apos;t believe it !
i &apos;ve been praying with pastor saeed &apos;s wife for his release .
rand , stand you ground for us !
very sorry for your loss , ms. blackburn .
thank senator tim scott for protecting the unborn .
ellen lambert , rand did not vote yes to that !
i am a tn republican with children in tn public schools .
i agree with you , rep. lou
congress holds the purse .
i hope you know we demand you gop keep your word !
rand thinks like obama .
i love the sound of martha roby too .... keep up the good work
2016 president paul
jennifer : apple computer &apos;s effective tax rate is less than 10 % .
say hi to hagan for me .
so proud you represent us tim scott
what are you and the republican majority going to do about it ?
this plan : absolutely not !
go mia shake the bushes and make these people accountable
devos is unqualified and incompetent .
no of course not .
i just love the constitution .
good luck mr. tillis
mccain obviously did not read the executive order .
mccain is an rino who long ago failed to defend and uphold the constitution .
devos does not come close to qualifying for this position .
mia no love for equal protection under the law .
well then james langford , get busy starting some impeachment movements against him .
very disappointed you endorsed marco rubio .
i am a teacher and am ashamed you and lankford represent oklahoma .
tell your buddy john mccain , not to vote for this traitor .
don &apos;t sell the us out but yet again to big oil mike crapo .
elise , please stay focused on the north country issues and dump trump !
that the message i get mia love
prayers keep fighting trey !
does anyone in our goverment care ?
obama is too uppity for your taste .
i so do not agree , sir !
please stand firm for our freedoms in washington .
this is never going to stop all government does is take and take
lets eliminate welfare and put the poor in soup kitchens and flop houses !
then give our country a good tax plan without all the extras .
we need a 3rd party ! !
for the lord loves justice ; he will not forsake his saints .
hey , gary monson , who wrote the budget that reagan signed in 1981 ?
don &apos;t replace it .
border security should be enforced before we legalize the illegals .
repeal obamacare and leave it to the free market !
rand , about time to raise hell with boehner who is a wossy .
maybe we should close the border until we get answers .
glad this isn &apos;t about the kids best interests ... please reconsider .
because he doesn &apos;t know what &apos;s in the bill anymore than obama does .
same old tired junk he &apos;s been serving up for 5 years now .
the hell with you paul ryan ! !
impeach hem lindsey graham , keep working on it please .
at least our kentucky representative got it right .
impeachment is in order
mitch for sure
dream team ... trump / cruz 2016
is this grounds for impeachment ?
this is the most massively unqualified nominee in history .
it is a simple question and i think an obvious question .
send mia to washington ! !
republicans now stand for nothing
don &apos;t stop now with debt ceiling , benghazi and guns and furious .
many thanks for at least one lawmaker in sc with good sense .
lindsey , says he uses principled compromise .
both sides are our enemy !
good luck mia i &apos;m confident for you !
you tell them rand
if you vote for this congressman , you will be creating more government .
i would not raise the debt ceiling .
mr. obama bellows it in every speech .
keep fighting for us , mr. gowdy !
congresman , the only reason i know about you is because of mike church .
wyoming has an amazing and high quality public school system .
in 2012 , house republicans tried to cut benefits while privatizing healthcare .
i &apos;m sure he will love it shutting the government down ! !
the supreme court has over-stepped it &apos;s authority and has become lawmaker .
they also knew the president would veto it .
this may be obama &apos;s straw that does us in .
john , the military spending is just not a large part of the budget .
now why don &apos;t you hold their feet over the fire on spending ?
no chris christie -- marco rubio for sure !
so silly vern .
dhs is unconstitutional anyway .
he would have come up with the healthcare called obamacare .
praying for mercy for our country from the lord .
liberty meetings .
congratulations from jones creek texas
plus obamacare needs to be repealed .
people who purchase on line do pay tax to the vendors they buy from .
mccain rambling about rand ... on cnn ... wtf is he talking about ?
i agree , trey would lead our country as it should be !
dont hesitate to take on the establishment when you know you are right .
mitch is not working towards or helping increase coal mining jobs .
don &apos;t let the rino &apos;s bully you into pc submission .
emily hurts her own campaign just by the d after her name .
why did u quit running ?
nixon did watergate and was going to be impeached !
be open minded to people like fiorina , rubio and kasich
that oligarchy that runs this nation is above all that .
stay locked down and get this government funded now .
our freedom
break party lines and have a backbone for what is right !
definitely no ! !
vote rand paul !
paul wants to save are constitution and mccain / graham want to destroy it
no americans at this point have been killed by the syrian government .
he is going to do whatever keeps israel safe .
unfortunately the obama zombies don &apos;t have brains .
after the pep rally are y &apos;all gonna go get pizza and lollipops together ?
paul ryan was thinking about the future , and future elections .
so what are you going to do about it mr. lankford ?
when are they going to get rid of him .
stand firm against this disaster tyranny = obamacare
praying for our christian to stand for christ !
you to sir god bless you and your family
john amen ! ! !
it is too simple for them to understand mr. gowdy .
maybe he should have talked more about how to reduce out of control spending .
impeach obama .. get a new start for america .. please !
listen to kurt gowdy
little late to the party
this is why i like and support mia love !
shame on you for voting for the supremely unqualified betsy devos .
thanks to obama and his ilk .
you make me proud to say i am from sc .
you need to impeach the idiot an let &apos;s send in the marines
they same to you sir !
you are right on the money lee ! ! !
i hope mia love is our first female president !
obama , is an evil man .
stop raising the debt ceiling and playing us as fools with your bba stance .
georgia voters ask your self what has johnny done .
why hasn &apos;t congress done something about obama ?
i can say that devos does not empower parents !
thanks for nothing , mr. ryan .
hopefully those aren &apos;t christian prayers you &apos;re praying .
you are a rino and no better than obama .
mia , you have it so right .
republicans caved in , pure and simple
lindsey shares more in common with bush than hillary does with obama .
this senator is 1 of the few reasons i would miss georgia .
bring home the troops and let them protect the border
but she will get it right next time and vote against boehner .
lee zeldin loves led zeppelin !
senator corker - you have lost my vote !
i am so sick of obama and his cronies and their deceit .
and look what our government has done to a true american .
i am so disappointed in the republican party !
tell obama to let the border patrol do their job .
a cr bill should be just that ... a cr bill .
bush sr said no new taxes , all we got was more war .
good luck mr rubio .
i like mia love , good luck from washington
ted cruz is correct .
i know johnny , you can`t handle that word bipartisan .
i hope he stays away from the us .
carly for me .............. woman and so smart ! ! ! ! ! !
reid needs to be fired ! ! ! !
stick to ron paul &apos;s message
this problem was brought about by the epa rules our country .
get him rand !
president obama has no such power .
rush is a idiot but he is a rich idiot
i have a few questions for mr. upton .
run with ryan in 2016 ! !
mr crapo .
why are we not impeaching this president ?
the only foundation of a free constitution is pure virtue . &quot;
i think the real question is why can &apos;t the republicans win more seats .
and still , the debt piles up
lets see how much you do about it mitch .
intelligent cool headed real south dakotan vs. double talking dc politician = no contest !
but vern voted no on bailing out the big three late last year .
we the american people expect alot more from our elected officials .
your time is coming marco rubio ! !
i am still a big fan of yours , mia love !
great interview on fox and friends this morning !
he needs to get the hell out of our country !
now that we have a republican president he &apos;s now out spoken ?
he is tearing apart our constitution , our government , and our country !
keep up the good work imus and thanks for your support senator mccain .
its time for a new sc senator ! ! ! !
we should stop supporting saudi arabia period .
stop the president &apos;s frivolous spending plan !
you are a traitor congressman
what is conservative about being a deadbeat nation ?
mccain and obama is on the same team ! ! ! !
marsha , do you know what discretionary spending is yet ?
if not , you are not qualified to assert any opinion regarding liberalism .
we should live moral lives , embracing christ and the principles he taught us .
next time talk to rep. trey gowdy first .
don &apos;t be afraid to stand up to the president and his closest advisors .
just hoping o bummer won &apos;t veto it .
you &apos;re a disgrace , cornyn .
pass a clean cr bill you terrorist ...
was obama qualified to be president of the usa ?
we need take all your pay away for allowing constitution to be broken .
happy thanksgiving trey gowdy and to yours .
take lindsey graham with you .
couldn &apos;t you have had this fight over the tsa instead ?
i worked on more ranch fence being destroyed by illegal aliens .
haven &apos;t heard anything from south carolina people in washington about the tpp agreement .
john mccain , man up and just say no !
quit standing with them and do something .
if not good enough congress why do we want it .
can we get holder on this ? ?
liberty is an abjectness !
cutting spending would likely not even drop the deficit to a balanced budget .
secure the borders first !
it gets worse ; the obama administration actually offers illegal alien gang members amnesty .
the media has not been reporting on the turmoil in egypt at all .
i completely agree that government spending needs to be reigned in .
hold the line on the debt limit .
the establishment republicans don &apos;t know what republicanism is anymore .
well that &apos;s disappointing .
please reconsider your choice .
trey is my choice for justice of supreme court .
the time is right to question the continued shunning of our founding document .
sadder yet , is that the patriot has literally not stopped even one attack .
what does rhino mean ? ? ?
what debt ceiling plan ?
obama has set the agenda .
this nation will be judged with the almighty god !
how about praying for the constitution ...
god bless you , mia love .
congressman erik paulsen you should look to justin amash for advice .
carly did good in the first one ....
you &apos;re a idiot , tim .
good interview mr scott !
nahhh .. they aren &apos;t going to listen anyway .
prayers for the hall family
give them a hearing &amp; send them home .
senator scott , please fight this !
our leaders need to quit being blind to obama &apos;s agenda .
target = zero debt , can not do it with increasing spending
we would probably clear out all the birds in south dakota .
god bless america we chose wisely .
i never would have guessed that ..
tom , i think you have been addressing republican crowds or writing phony crap .
what are all the other hired hands doing about it , mr mcclintock ?
notice sam graves puts out facebook posts like this but never responds ?
god bless you lindsey graham
better yet obama now agreed to export us natural gas !
and god is allowing him to do what he wants to do .
i hope you are the next speaker !
obama has turned american dream into nightmares
i mean paul ryan ... not my dog .
god bless mr. crawford .
great attitude mr. ryan .
reagan least fav current chump in charge pos
question is what are we gonna do about it .
rand our political watch dog ! ! !
aca should not be coupled with passing a cr and opening the government .
fistfight : john mccain and stephen speilberg- who would win ?
make up your mind sam .
he has never been a champion of conservative principles .
i think he knows the dictatorship needs to change if cuba is to survive .
the guy needs to take a course on how to speak .
i just moved here from florida .
love you mia keep up the great fight
consider the source rand .
i think you would disagree , as would i. please reconsider sir .
they are probably giving him something in return .
i agree with a republican !
we cannot keep letting him ignore the constitution ! !
no accountability typical federal b / s
the house needs to stand firm on the payroll tax cut .
but good for mr. paul .
yet flat tax us at 10 percent period .
impeachment on what grounds ?
oh , come on , mr. speaker .
it only gives our enemy more reasons to attack us .
no to cloture or no to another one of my supporting votes .
shouldn &apos;t we do something about it ?
you are supposed to represent tennessee and it &apos;s children .
everytime ron paul is on , he agrees with everything he says !
listen to your constituents , bob .
they start calling republican &apos;s names , the republicans run off crying !
you so called christians remember what jesus commanded us to do .
it was a great speach and he &apos;s a great speaker !
like most everything else , the government has messed it all up .
i love you rubio and i hope one day someone is introducing you !
god bless you for the work you are doing for our country .
i certainly hope you are no longer the speaker .
mrs. devos lacks the experience and understanding necessary to lead this department .
america needs 534 more like you , lee .
i join u in commending sen paul , and i commend u as well ...
senator you will not serve another term with views like this !
congress ought to push to hold our rogue potus to account .
start impeachment proceedings please .
sen graham , i won &apos;t throw any insults .
no devos - she is not qualified.time to find a new senator from tennessee .
besides , where in the constitution does it mention jobs ?
rand can be supported in other ways from outside the state .
time for god and god bless america to come back .
a vote yes for devos is a slap in the face to ga students .
you are so absolutely wrong ! !
no filing tax returns .
thank god for the stand taken by ted cruz &amp; mike lee .
god bless america and god bless ron paul !
he got schooled by ron paul
you can &apos;t buy enough votes to elect a socialist without borrowing .
can you and vitter re-introduce doing away with obama phones .
marco rubio was my guy .
put gowdy in charge remove boehner ...... we need someone with testicular fortitude !
there is enough fertilizer in washington , d.c. for a nuke blast
impeach now , before millions more come to our once great nation .
your awsome rand ! !
online poker = jobs , tax revenue and personal freedom .. please support hr2366
impeach this traitor and the people will stand with you ... ! !
congratulaions james way to go
trey run for president now ... our country needs your leadership !
shut the government down ! !
obey him because he is god
we need to get d.c. out of it !
congressman lankford , i support your point of view and your vote .
an obama lap dog--you trashed the confederate flag was part of history you moron
happy easter and god bless you and your family ...
trey you are one that i trust and respect .
where will the nations debt be in ten years under the ryan budget ?
as for tom , he is obviously a chuck pergason supporter .
rand , punch john mccain in the nose please : )
marsha american people looking for big change next year !
then why did you vote for the omnibus bill !
no experience in public education ?
i will be surprised if you keep your position as speaker .
he should be impeached right now .
re reagan .
james lankford you &apos;re an awesome guy !
only white conservatives can pull the christ card ?
we would allow god to be the author of our son &apos;s life .
carter begot ragan obama begot paul
the people in va are praying for the people in az .
i think mr. romney is unraveling at the seams .
uh mia what about all the hard working americans that are benefiting from obamacare ?
you guys must have thought we were talking about a budget .
did you give up on defunding it ?
he has now lost my vote .
u sir have done a great job ! !
ms. cain is all fluff and no stuff .
we can overturn a veto .
you sir are just like the repubtards .
when are you and our impotent congress going to do something about it ?
obamacare is one of the worst things that has ever been enforced .
i am a failure i resign
the problem is those stupid democrats don`t have the guts to stand up to obama
senator paul , congratulations !
you have lost my respect , sir .
i guess the founding fathers were wacko birds too .
with obamas dictatorship and cuban communism .
out of touch , tom tillis .
no need to wear the hood now you piece of crap .
can we do nothing tom ?
didn &apos;t rubio say he wasn &apos;t going to run for his senate seat ?
if you are confused , remember what neil bortz advised : always default to freedom
senator mccain i agree with you on this .
you , mr. mcconnell , haven &apos;t served us nearly as well .
senator isakson , support and stand with cruz and lee !
the good lord is in full control .
tim , your comments are well stated .
get back yee satan ... all of you in dc
releasing the enemy from gitmo .
obama resign .
we the people do not want oboma care !
he had a constitutional fire storm and handled it well .
matt was responding to a comment cindy made that included paul ryan .
there &apos;s a reason anal-ist is spelled the way it is lindsey .
someone that has no business with this property wants it .
you &apos;re a little late to the party mr .
there is a way thur article 5 of the constitution .
obama will never stand up for anyone except his fellow moslems .
betsy devos isn &apos;t the answer to help the public school system .
carly
my question is why nothing is being done to stop it .
why have we not started impeachment of this traitor ?
cut the defence budget in half now !
sue pardi muslims are exempt from obama care also .
is the epa a non american jobs loving communists group ? ? ?
best of luck rand .
shame on you ted !
sir , please vote no for cloture !
2016 , sir .
he should have stood firm and voted &quot; no &quot; on the debt deal .
i guess some of them may have read the constitution .
there is no way i would pull reid out of a burning car .
lord knows you are trying your best .
i thought carson , cruz an d rubio shone .
sir , cars are not mentioned in the constitution .
praying for you as you serve us ! ! !
i am in the 2 / 3rds that want this administration gone .
so sorry james !
common core is a states initiative that is not funded by the federal govt .
he is going to talk in circles until your time with him is up .
that &apos;s fine lee .
not only no , but he &apos;ll no !
yes ... a flat tax would be nice !
mccain should have died in the hilton hotel .
a lot of patriots have you back brother
pass the zadroga act now # worstresponders
pray for truth to prevail !
look at this administration bob it is 10x &apos;s worse then nixon and watergate
has it ever happened while drones are spying on the american people ?
this administration doesn &apos;t tell any truths -- impeachment should be first priority !
sorry mr. paul .
the spending has got to stop .
before he totally destroys our country !
well done trey and god bless you !
beautiful message from you senator rubio -- i know you are a future president .
stay strong mia love
time for you to retire along with the other rino
the real question is when is congress going to put a stop to this ?
kill the internet tax
tom , you have this one right !
obama has increased our national debt by more than 6 trillion .
god bless you , scott .
vote to repeal , it looks like more government red tape and bureaucracy .
we are praying for you as you stand for freedom .
there is no god .
quit bitching and do something about it
and you , sir , are part of the problem in washington .
agree , stand your ground , james .
we the people should have better , from our gov .
i want to see your statement on blocking obama &apos;s supreme court nomination .
impeach him , then try him for treason , and subversion
lets bring our soldiers home and allow them to defend us for a change .
thad the dirtbag ..... supports obama the lying scumbag
betsy devos is not qualified to serve our nation as secretary of education .
but in the end , the american people need actions , not words .
i admire trey and he really made my day ..
... same question to senator scott .
then have speaker b conduct a vote on a clean cr .
you have my support , sir .
vote no on this monster of an amnesty bill .
i &apos;m praying you will be our attorney general next year ! ! ! !
you are a great person and a wonderful senator for wyoming mr. enzi !
a little late paul , don &apos;t you think ? ? ? ?
wait , o does not have to follow the law .
enzi doesn &apos;t care .
bz sir !
make it happen rand paul .
it wasn &apos;t the republican party .
take obama to court over the misuse of executive power .
it is time for them to be held accountable for waste in government .
no taxation without representation !
the gop house needs to force obama to open up drilling here .
paul you are fired ! ! !
congressman , vote no and listen to the voice of your district .
trey gowdy , wishing you a blessed and happy easter !
come on ted cruz !
no budget no pay for congress
we need for you to stand firm .
start with repealing obamacare .
there will never be another reagan .
carly nailed it !
mr. palazzo i agree .
count on mccain to be the first traitor out of the gate .
have they ever held anyone accountable for anything ?
i hear about it alot from my conservative friends .
reagan was very clear that the problem we have is big government .
no war without abiding by the constitution .
vote no for cloture
neither does the fact that we are funding the enemies of israel !
you have been hanging with the judge too much ! !
you did not get rid of obamacare which supposedly you are so against .
the debt payment account for about 10 % of current revenues .
obama is bypassing the laws of the land .
thank yo so much rand !
obama can &apos;t raise taxes when the house and senate majority are republican !
lindsey who ?
seal the border like we do south korea !
hopefully , it is not too late !
obamacare has got to go .. how could that have been passed ?
marsha is for america .
prayers are going up god bless
tell them they need to stand firm against king o .
support senator cruz in his fight to defend our liberty .
i &apos;m with team mitch here in se kentucky !
betsy devos is a completely unqualified candidate for sec ed .

you did great on wamu today sir !
so lamborn , quit touting the patriot rhetoric .
obama doesn &apos;t want kill his friends
darrel , i hope you can be the next speaker .

american soldier turned constitutional traitor !
praying for a miracle for your little one !
you and trey gowdy can get to the bottom of everything .
senator mccain , you need to listen to your people .
major spending cuts !
shame on you lankford you give the university of texas a bad rap .
conservatives teach people what it took to be free .
we therefore do not need a federal government either .
senator graham , you stripped away our right to a trial .
keep fighting sir we will !
betsy devos is totally unqualified to head the department of education .
boehner is just pelosi in a suit and your vote for the obama-backed budget .
we have been running a deficit both financially and morally rand paul .
you ned to run from washington john you are nothing but a ush boy .
signed , a lifelong republican who is tired of this mess
lynn shue for county commissioner cabarrus county .
did you teach him about what small government and increased liberty actually means ?
semper fi to you , keep s.c. strong !
thank-you mr sasse for bringing this up .
of course i agree
so &quot; o &quot; can veto it ..
hell yes , from charloote , nc to greenville / spartanburg , sc .
please don &apos;t choose paul ryan .
just hope things change in 2014 for s.c.
don &apos;t get sucked in to the washington , d.c. way .
mitch is sellout
say no to common core and the selling out of america &apos;s school children .
keep doing what you do , rand !
let &apos;s start the rubio 2016 campaign ! !
we do not need government in control of one-fifth of the economy .
yes - vote boehner out !
i &apos;m all for lindsey and he will do and say the right thing .
stop sending aid to countries that wish us harm .
we should all mail this to obama .
just get us back to the constitution and let the individuals work it out .
reid has not done it yet and will not again .
lmao you truly are pathetic , rand paul .... congrats !
better late than never , but worried about your job instead of the party !
so do something about it tom , you control the house .
america has had enough of rubio !
i wasn &apos;t sure when we were supposed to put them back out again .

gene ... ollie was ordered by president reagan to trade the arms .
mia your words are beautiful !
i don &apos;t believe this administration has any intention of cutting the spending .
boehner understood that .
tell everyone you know to vote for james on august 24th .
make the proposal on the sunday shows for free advertisement tim !
so why do we need to raise the debt ceiling .
you won &apos;t listen , i have no money to give you .
for now , bring to vote the last president &apos;s nominee .
why not arrest obama for treason , and take care of the problem !
have you lost your freaking mind senator rand paul !

even if some such as ryan plan only starts addressing the issues .
american &apos;s are sick obama muslim behind .
tim , we need to completely stop ( defund ) that piece of crap .
i have never taken your bumper stick off of my car .
impeach the idiot
behind you all the way , rand !
just go away johnny !
i wish these gutless congressmen would go home !
james lankford , that is just not true .
she will be impeached and it is absurd to blindly waltz into the process .
i am convinced that obama is out to destroy our country .
you must oppose cloture to stop harry reid &apos;s plan to fund obamacare .
praying obumercare never comes to pass lord have mercy
cut cut cut cut
save education and vote no for devos !

scott , are you supporting the tea party congressman ? ? ? ?
trey i wish you were in the cabinet picks !
i do not support anything the general government does any longer .
reagan or bush
agreement here with others that said a bit to late
obama impeachment for executive orders on guns ?
thanks for all that you do marsha .
totally agree bruce !
he has turned his back on arizona he is a disgrace to the american people
love ron paul , like rand paul , hate mark levin
no on syria and refuse funding on obama care .
the first vote needs to be a no for devos .
the present administration is also a threat to this nation .
get your story and facts straight , rand !
we are being granted some liberties by government but we are to have liberty .
james , it hasn &apos;t changed my vote for change .
reagan tripled the national debt .
finish the fence first then talk about the next stage .
prayers from virginia are with you and family , senator scott !
you really think he will stick to budget .
senator mcconnell , you are such a liar
the also call themselves conservatives .
all they need now is saudi arabia and that is next .
where is this massive tax revenues going to come from ! ! ? ?
this is the reason i am not voting for scott angelle .
keep fighting dr. paul !
we the people did that on our own without politicians .
tom , where did you get this information ... ?
i know you are a brave , honorable american patriot .
yes , we need to secure of border .
pull your head out vern and start handling the real issues .
make them hear you rand
obama is just being a spiteful , spoiled brat .
the american people did have a voice by electing our current president twice .
hope the senate will pass it also .
conservatives nation wide know you &apos;re a sheep in wolf &apos;s clothing .
we must stop obama move to destroy the usa .
have lost confidence in mccain .
kansas has not embraced it like other states so we really can &apos;t say .
a conservative or libertarian would never abandon principals and support these rinos !
no money , no power .
and are you going to stand by and let obama do this to american
marco is our future !
why won &apos;t the fbi arrest george soros or deport him .
n inporte quit
congress is still not exempt from obamacare .
this crap is outta hand lee , do something .
from columbia sc you have my vote
we need to get the commies out of america .
that is why we sent you to congress .
otherwise it &apos;s a poll tax .
i will only support true conservatives from now on .
destroying this country is osama &apos;s goal &amp; boner will help him !
no one will be exempt except washington .
we all know this so why isn &apos;t congress do anything about it ! !
( y ) we stand with rand !
sorry to hear about your dad
anybody but obummer
may god bless you , tim !
she is the most unqualified candidate for secretary of education .
repeal it &amp; shread &amp; trash it .
god bless and keep you all !
get over it james it happened 11 years ago .
obama and his army !
happy easter and happy passover to you and your family sen. rubio .
may god bless you my friend .
by god &apos;s grace , i will not surrender my constitutional convictions .
why hasn &apos;t this man been impeached ?
to bad you could not have helped your party months ago , very disappointed .
i am donating my status , marco .
he should be in prison along with obama .
if we give obama a inch he &apos;ll take a mile !
therefore obamacare is illegal !
i am a constituent from middle tennessee and i do not support her nomination .
that &apos;s why the debt ceiling has to be raised every few months .
impeachment is the only answer to this treasonous dictator
mike , the problem is not the search it is the government involvement .
don &apos;t let boehner bribe you .
keep on putting it out there mr buchanan .
is that fat boy stupid or a traitor too
might as well have osama instead of obama !
ban all flights out of those countrys and send medical personnel not our military !
evidently our brilliant government can &apos;t figure it out though !
i am not interested in those unsecured obama exchanges .
time to impeach he got to go
no i just saw where it is close so no hagan isn &apos;t ahead .
christie should be out .
get out like ted did and call out leadership by name ! !
thanks for the help israel !
he is a disgraced rino .
coward in a uniform , traitor to his nation !
if gowdy says it ----i believe it !
no one has answered what part of the constitution was violated .
if we don &apos;t try , then they absolutely get their way .
washed up rino
bravo marco .
rubio got my vote .
and when the debt ceiling hit tell the rothschild &apos;s to get bent .
presidential vacations you say ?
no one in healthcare wants obama care .
he needs to be put on a short rope to a snubbing post .
she &apos;s possibly the least qualified nominee i &apos;ve ever seen .
mike , please do not leave washington now .
may god bless you and your &apos;s .
i &apos;m not from kentucky but rand is by far my favorite politician .
cuba still harboring convicted killers and terrorists .
we wanted a balanced budget .
sending arms to our enemies , shows how incompetent our congress is .
they are wanting socialism all the way .. communism .
good luck , marco rubio .
mr. amish , washington d.c. is not full of principled people .
mr. rubio was the one true hope conservatives had to beat the machine .
yeah i know obama is going to give you hope and change .
please represent the people of tennessee and vote to reject this supremely unqualified nominee .
do you think american principles are not better than this ?
she will not curb late term abortions .
you didn &apos;t embarrass the republican party , nor the democrats .
no problem all is well ----haha .
good man , may god bless and keep him .
kick their face in rand !
stop government spending .
we do not want obamacare under any circumstance !
reagan made 30 ! ! !
hey tom how do we get rid of obama !
then hang him !
2016 marco rubio for president
how about total tax reform , with flat taxes .
he wasn &apos;t elected king and he has no ability to lead .
as far as charleston is concerned .
there is no exemption or special treatment from obamacare for congress &amp; the president .
tyler &apos;s paradise , obama isn &apos;t american either .
it &apos;s ridiculous to talk about repeal until you lay out your replacement plan .
love rand paul ! ! !
we need to consider god &apos;s definition of personhood rather than your definition !
you shouldn &apos;t have voted for boehner johnny .
aid to israel comprises more than 50 % of the foreign aid budget .
bring them home to defend our borders !
congressman ryan , where were you sir ?
we need to cut spending sir , and we need to do it now .
please restore the freedom to play american based online poker .
mr thune , i ask you as an american .
do not fund any part of obamacare .
good 4 u &amp; rand
paul , i think you may be engaging in a little hyperbole .
and , jail him until he pays his back taxes .
you are in congress do something about it ...
its one of the few things he has done right ! ! !
so , no , he is profiting off of and using the american people .
praying and voting for you scott !
we must pray for each other .
shame on you , lamar alexander .
we have had 3 amnesty programs that i can remember .
principals sir , sometimes you have to be a whacko bird .
like &quot; no &quot; immigration reform ?
your a true patriot sir .
boehner is not well equipped for the task ! ! !
&quot; more authority is fine with me . &quot;
obuma needs to go .
where &apos;s the stance for freedom and security .
he wants to close gitmo and put troops in syria ? ? ? ? ?
typical harry reid fashion .
time to go away rand .
you are making conservatives proud !
the people that voted you into office do not want immigration reforms .
this was not amnesty by any stretch of the imagination .
please show them that tennessee has drawn a line in the sand !
rand is a sellout to the republican elite !
praying for you to seek and receive wisdom from god !
repeal the 16th and 17th amendments .
they are elected to uphold the constitution and represent the people .
for all of us , god bless you .
and when did obama start reading the constitution .
the thanks go to you rand .
how we to know programs are illegal if congressmen can &apos;t do their job !
for once i agree with you sir .
being a dad is the best job you will ever have !
5 shelbyville , tn .
it &apos;s your constitutional duty to advise and consent .
send the illegals home !
keep the irs out of our health care .
those who are responsible for benghazi need to be held accountable ! !
no confidence in current government .
say no to any obama nominee ! !
putting them on our church prayer list !
i must have missed fox news filtered and polished portrayal of obama .
maybe ya &apos;ll should of voted for him when he ran for president .
i am very disappointed that you are not holding a town meeting .
it costs too much and it &apos;s not good enough for obama !
so it seems i found the answer on your yea to betsy devos .
ms. davos is the most unqualified individual for this position .
how about we just abolish the irs and institute a consumption tax .
looking forward to see what he does for our military .
it &apos;s his third veto .
we need to unite and get him out of office before its too late .
sick of spineless politicians ! !
praying that together the administration can protect and heal our great nation .
well no wonder ... look at all the stuff we pay taxes on !
why don &apos;t you listen to the people and defund obamacare today !
then you are circumventing the constitution .
agree with you tim .
lol just like thom said himself and his children are laughing at the haters !
nothing- can &apos;t believe anything he says !
stand aside mr. what ever your name is !
the fbi is talking about three emails that were on the server .
yates was standing up for the constitution .
now you need to override obama &apos;s internet give away on oct .
there &apos;s rubio wanting to keep getting the lobby money and soros money !
you and john mccain are jackasses
please continue to support our constitution !
rand ... i will work for your mission ... just contact me ... louisville ky
even you neighbors to the west stand with you mia ! !
keep up the good work cathy god bless
no sorry that is the last thing we need , more government , , ,
praise be to god !
thank-you trey gowdy for helping up keep safe and congress too .
maybe obama wants to take more expensive vacations with the extra tax money .
you lost my support with amnesty .
term limits and get rid of all lobbyists .
just repeal it please not replace .. thanks
trey gowdy : &quot; huge gaps &quot; in clinton &apos;s libya-related emails ?
move to impeach the creature inhabiting the white house .
it &apos;s why we love you , sir ted !
marco needs to do the jb he was elected to do
james you &apos;re in our prayers
absolute morons with no intestinal fortitude !
team mitch on november 4th ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
impeachment / jail ! !
no no no no to all of this mess
do you really think castro n his regime will let the people go ?
shame on you , sen. thune !
hope and pray it &apos;s not to late .
plase help stop sending aide to other countries and start helping americans at home
will cost a lot thanks to george bush .
that was not the intent of the constitution .
not so sure about bruce .
enjoy the beauty of aspen , mia !
ray hit jerry up he believes in wealth spreading .
love you mia love !
godspeed from north carolina and congrats
maybe we need to clean house with both our senators from north carolina .
o lord help our children
people our goverment cannot disarm us .
carly seagren
just pass a clean cr .
it seems like the first place to cut spending should be these useless wars .
no marion we are fighting for liberty .
good going mr &quot; i should take this seriously ! &quot;
praying for you because you are the best chance we have .
i again say no sir !
i agree replace it , not because its a government take over .
make him veto and own it
it does not matter what he says he is a liar and a deceiver .
there is certainly nothing affordable about obamacare .
sounds good sir , you have our full support .
keep up the good work mr gowdy
betsy devos is so obviously unqualified as education secretary .
you blew it , paul ! ! !
why wait until it is too late !
they are absolutely worthless .
enforce the existing laws and leave the constitution alone .
then stop him !
prosperity is not built on tax cuts for the rich and excessive military spending .
mrs. rubio he is a wonderful congressman and would have made a wonderful president .
venice too vern !
he won &apos;t get my vote if he did .
you can overturn his veto .
i sure wish we had more representatives like you sir ! ! !
a call to congress to enforce this law !
potus is in charge of foreign affairs until it comes time to ratify treaties .
for starters we will defund planned parenthood and enforce doma . &quot;
no federal employee is going to be required .
it is so true ! !
he needs to be voted out of office !
as americans we deserve nothing but truth from all our elected officials
pull our troops and aid back home .
i been thinking for a while that you kiss obama &apos;s butt !
trump cruz
our national debt is trillions .
i happened to be on a flight yesterday with marco from miami to laguardia .
thank god obama will veto it .
epa is another one of obama &apos;s right arm bullies ..
vern sees money for him in voting this way .
trey for attorney general ! ! !
this administration is always a few steps ahead of you .
you said it best marco .
repeal your own healthcare first .
praying for you - god can work miracles ! !
roy blunt lied to win ; impeach roy blunt now ! !
they will never take them away we the people want stand for it .
yes we want congress to work together but not for obama .
we lost lives in benghazi and nothing was done---i would have backed that .
rand we cant just give them everything , are you obamafied ?
that will increase tax revenue , decrease government dependence and increase the gdp .
tired of hearing your talk and no action ... go back to rino land ...
honor the flag today , thanks marco .
you can repeal obamacare when congress gives up their free health care
he &apos;s a traitor also .
what part of vote no on the cloture didn &apos;t you understand ? ! ?
the people in charleston were awesome .
right now securing our borders are our # 1 priority .
ask mr paul .
you have all our support mike !
john mccain , godfather of isis .
hopefully not to little to late
since she has absolutely no experience with public education she is a poor choice .
big mistake for the republican party .
congressman , unfortunately it &apos;s too late .
that went no where fast and only make the people more furious .
it is time we start abiding by our constitution .
fat liberal pig who a t &apos;s as if he is conservative
no write in cruz
we need a real conservative !
marco : god bless you and your family .
it &apos;s time to turn a new leaf s. carolina .
where are accountable tn pols when we need them ?
thoughts and prayers are with amanda and the entire rubio family .
hillary should be left in the enemies hands along with obama
say what the constitution says not make up your own extremist paranoia .
i &apos;m hopeful we will someday see mia in congress !
still haven &apos;t heard any replacement nearly as good or effective .
janice cline , summerville , sc
at least 0ne of our congressmen has a little backbone .
no pension , no medical coverage .
did ted cruz tell you to vote no on this also ?
i am praying that our heavenly father will give them peace .
and obviously neither can our govt .
this will help oklahoma greatly .
rand my friend you spare no venom and i love it !
why can &apos;t you vote for that one , congressman dave reichert ?
good morning congressman mike simpson !
start the impeachment process please
barrackk obama public enemy number 1
nothing , , cause we have a spineless government
folks we must help rand if we believe in the right to life
yes sir !
our prayers are with her .
i really like rand but coal needs to be a thing of the past .
they lie just like obummer head muslim !
no war , no strike , no drones
maybe u do not understand what fair tax would b ?
marsha can go ahead and take a pay cut then .
and to you as well sir
seems hypocritical tim .
ok , here &apos;s a pet peeve about flag ettiquette .
this family has been supporting your dad since his first run for office .
this country will only default if obama orders that the bills wont be paid .
rubio so is dtrump don the con !
good luck mia pete sprinville utah
congrats senator scott to you and him !
i still have my mccain sign out !
but , washington gops don &apos;t want to pass a comprehensive immigration bill .
he needs to get out of the white house , that should be closed too
as a cuban i am surprised rubio would make this statement .
not sure what the chances are that harry reid will do the right thing .
will you , congressman zeldin push to utilize this path ?
merry christmas to you lynn and your family .
you and mia love ! ! !
these are the enemies from within .
isn &apos;t marco out of a job the end of this year ?
it &apos;s costing mccain millions in campaign contributions .
republicans warn that higher tax rates could throw our economy back into recession .
so far y &apos;all have done absolutely nothing but turn your backs on us ..
we the people are smarter than you think !
i too am a fiscal conservative .
paul - palin 2016 !
i sure wish support was with rand !
have a great day sir !
how to win the war on optics and call check mate on obama .
where in the constitution is the authority to do this ?
the &quot; new &quot; congress should have a new speaker .
ryan is a continuation of boehner , without the tears ! ! !
yes , we have a spending problem .
fight against obamacare and amnesty for illegals .
praying for you and for others to follow your lead .
the constitution state he is not above the law .
thank u mr. upton for standing behind this no budget no pay .
praying amen # gowdy2020
without obamacare millions do not .
trey gowdy is the best thing ever to come out of south carolina .
give &apos;em hell rand !
stand up , sir !
cruz - love 2016
this was no debate of any substance .
put the military on the borders .
no clintons !
am begging you to not vote for betsy devos .
first of all rand paul is a great american .
he needs to go hide in a hole and don &apos;t come out
mike and i have never been the kind of people to ask for anything .
also test welfare recipients .
tax tax tax is all we hear .
sorry lindsey , you said the wrong thing .
hey vern , is this really something you should post on fb ?
john boehner has been unprofessional several times before that have been questioned .
ahhh , that pesky constitution .
thanks ben - you &apos;ll make a great # 2 .
way to go marsha blackburn keep it up !
would have been nice if you supported our / your candidate months ago .
... and eric holder is still not in jail !
you are a disgrace to our country and the state of tennessee .
don &apos;t get too distracted thom .
john mccain please help .
obama = isis
well at least you made one correct vote mr. moran .
the american people voted for obama .
it does give you a better perspective , doesn &apos;t it rand ?
stop giving my money to these flag burnning savages .
yes my family will be praying for you .
given the opportunity , i would have voted for congressman pat tiberi .
i would like to know the answer to that question !
he has no clue except what his handlers tell him to do .
well i am not sure why congress isn &apos;t doing something about this administration .
we are praying for you all , louie ... wish i could be there ...
and by the way no government employee should be eligible for a bonus ! !
yes , we need more leaders like you , mia ! ! !
no not a clue
now bring impeachment charges against director comey and ag lynch
if he uses executive privilege again .
we have laws that keep us from praying in schools and public .
definitely un-liking you rand paul .
good riddance holder take your buddy with you !
i hope diane black did too .
you liberals believe everything the media wants you to believe !
i heard that rand and rubio did not vote in favor of this fiasco .
i pray that we dont end up in a civil war over this ! !
since when does the executive branch negotiate with terrorists .
hey tom mcclintock do you actually read comments ?
no change ?
i don &apos;t see them as empty promises , mia .
i &apos;m sad that i live in mia love &apos;s district .
so tell us lindsey , which is it ? ? ?
look for him to declare martial law !
tom does fully accountable really mean anything .
i doubt if trey gowdy will actually read my comments .
one way of virtually ensuring your reelection is to impeach the president asap .
by the way i called my ins .
i love romney but i vote rubio 2016 ! ! !
go , go , go johnny , go , go , go johnny go ,
government has told so many lies they can &apos;t remember the truth
cut spending , for our kids and grand kids .
they have mr congressman .
god bless you james lankfor !
you stopped being relevant to the republican party a long time ago .
your no jerry ford , paul henry , or vern ehlers thats for sure ...
have no doubt , rand paul would have won in a landslide against hillary .
i like what bruce has to say about welfare .
help no
paul ryan showed his hand today and must be held accountable .
obummer doesn &apos;t know how to make one or for nefarious reasons will not .
but the feds have less power over us ..........
merry christmas and god bless america and you
with obama it is all about the next election and the redistribution of wealth .
christ did about citizen &apos;s in florida , nothing is being done in louisiana .
y &apos;all need to go back and look at his voting record .
sponsor a bill setting term limits !
if is strictly ca republicans have no say anyway .
no she ain &apos;t related to connie rice in bush administration
it seems to me that republican leaders are in bed with liberal democrats .
of course obama will then take credit for it .
go mr boehner go !
good luck and we will keep you in our prayers .
make changes and get him out of office
rewrite nafta , fair tax now
the veto is dead on .
we need to get mia love and tim scott in the public eye .
spot on , sen. sasse .
marsha blackburn , you &apos;re doing a great job .
support our president until we weed out the enemies .
now , mr. congressman , you know that isn &apos;t true .
i have to agree with the majority of posters mr. paul ryan .
alabama mother praying for your family .
happy thanksgiving trey
republicans have made a political blunder , namely jack ryan .
sad that the post below this is the national prayer breakfast .
anyone w / any brains at all would not have put him in !
&quot; to legislate in an independent and conservative manner . &quot;
praying for charleston and all of her people .
spread that thought around up there tim .
please don &apos;t back down from obama .
pray that god will save us and restore our country .
hopefully we will get rid of him next time !
bout as much chance for transparency as snow in july in tn .
hey little johnny mccain jr. are you going to arm isis too ?
this is not about &quot; gay rights &quot; but religious freedom !
it is for the good of the government only .
why don &apos;t y &apos;all go ahead and remove the monuments as well .
do you honestly think that rand prefers romney over his father ?
i think not ..... grounds for impeachment .
god forbid we should be allowed a truly conservative candidate .
since it is obama , i can &apos;t agree .
obamacare is doomed to fail .
i just think that obama is a liar and wants to destroy america ...
actually , bruce bielby , the congressman did give equal time to nwmsu .
jerry james traficant told us about israel .
remember they hate americans and burn our flag
please stop all of your efforts to defund or delay obamacare .
nick amann we don &apos;t enforce the immigration laws we have now .
please vote no on the cloture for obamacare !
trey gowdy for attorney general .
jordan wood
massachusetts could certainly benefit having a principled man like trey gowdy representing us !
go , rand , go ! ! ! ! !
perhaps too late paul .
they just sent back a fourth compromise bill .
if williamson county wants them you guys can pay them .
no one is saying stop immigration .
oklahoma is known for it &apos;s common sense .
income tax and the federal reserve act was extremely destructive to the republic
screw the post marco !
just talk talk talk .
rep. love , you are once again making a valid agruement .
negotiating means compromises offered from the president and not just republicans !
please , repeal obamacare .
thanks mr. poe !
shame on fox having you on !
boehner and his lackeys did this , not the senate democrats .
happy thanksgiving to you trey gowdy &amp; may you &amp; your family be blessed .
time to stand up for america before it is to late .
you don &apos;t have my support or vote sir .
mr rubio in my opinion u are the one to watch !
dear senator mccain , i just left one of our ww ! !
stay with it tim .
we do not want paul ryan he ia just another bonner .
stand up for us and oppose any infringement on our 2nd amendment rights .
ben sasse has no solution .
about the same as your rhino voting record .
vote to defund it .
will do , james .
congressman you are beginning to sound like consummate politician .
we had also better rethink our foreign aid policies .
how about that lindsey graham ?
congratulations mike ! ! ! ! !
you are an embarrassment to ohio on par with boehner .
obama is poop
amen amen amen
praying god &apos;s will be done by our nation &apos;s leaders .
key question is what is border security ?
please hold a town hall soon .
chris christie should change parties .
thats why welfare is out of control ...
he needs to go ...
conservatives want less government !
insurance was the wrong method to begin with vern .
first , remove obama .
be a hero and start impeachment proceedings and a vote of no confidence .
when will trey gowdy run for potus ?
nobody cares what you say lindsey
time to pass a straight budget with no gimmicky add-ons about obamacare .
i hear mccain has accepted monies from george soros ? ?
why did you vote for john boehner to be speaker ?
dr. alveda king is continuing this legacy !
no way this corrupt admin .
you are the key to their misery , sir .
ms. devos has no experience in education administration or teaching .
the govt needs to drop the &quot; exemption &quot; from obamacare for govt employees .
how about giving the military power to go around obama ? .
may he rest in peace sir
so let the lord and them live with it .
sir , you should be ashamed .
irs is the most corrupt arm of our government .
bruce gets things done .
if you cant stand for something you will fall for anything .
quit lying to your constituents .
wish you were here in florida
you have lost my vote for life .
take a well deserved pay cut , johnny , you quack .
why can &apos;t we find a conservative to challenge her ?
you &apos;re still the best mr. gowdy !
dr. paul was my vote during the primary .

2 ) demand that we enforce all current immigration laws .
betrayed--that &apos;s your legacy now mr johnny rino !
to all who are disrespecting god , keep god out of this .
nice to have someone from sc to represent us .
they are treasonous traitors to this country and our soldiers .
even if it goes all the way to obama himself .
i am sure that you know she is unqualified .
instead of defending the constitution , he has been voting to dismantle it .
back to the swamp with you , sir .

right now cuba is an island prison .
oh , and please vote no on devos .
you should already know the main issues , sir .
have fun running and failing , rubio .
next thing after squashing obama care is to start charges of treason on obama .
in addition , &apos; the enemy of my enemy is my friend . &apos;
he has taken too many vacations .
thank the lord you got the nomination .
the massholes got robamney reelected , don &apos;t blame this on paul .
mr. sasse how about you run for president ?
i wonder where your fellow conservative republicans and god fearing democrats were last night .
barry is a dictator who doesn &apos;t love america !
he has shown he &apos;s all talk and no action .
you should be ashamed at your betrayal of south dakota .
stop the spending cut our debt .
rand rocks .
you are from nc and know the state of our education system .
fix our tax code rand !
vote ron paul .
trevor , i would not claim james is an idiot .

there is no simple fix .
just enforce the current immigration law ! just enforce the current immigration law !
let them all go play gold ... it will cost the american taxpayer less .
..... just like your immigration bill marco
trey gowdy .. you rock ...
i watched you on fox news this morning .
please hang in there mr gowdy !
we want our pow free and back home where he belongs .
no revenue .
please work with ted cruz and stop this .
impeachment proceedings would be a great idea .
4 ) vote to remove john boehner as speaker of the house .
i sometimes wonder if the trolls that we see here are even oklahoma citizens .
king obama ! !
senator how do we get comey out of office .
it is obvious that the obama administration is anti-american and anti-law .
no more entitlements or socialists policies bankrupting the us economy .
i kinda like rand paul .
they been doing it all over the nation !
steven only the congress can levy a tax , not the executive branch .
resign gowdy ... you are an amnesty supporting fraud .
the problem comes from the thousands of times obama declared he wouldn &apos;t negotiate .
mia love , you are beautiful and smart .
it has to start with obama and work its way down including lynch !
also kill the senate immigration bill .
please tell the party to drop the absurd gasoline tax idea !
just an old rhino that needs to be put out to pasture
this administration is out of control with the hardware we have built !
while you &apos;re at it ... get rid of boehner !
good work , sir !
he blessed us with you serving in congress for us .
bless you mia love !
was charging exorbitant tariffs on commerce across its border .
i hate jeb , christie and rubio .
unfortunately , too many other republicans lacked the intestinal fortitude to take a stand .
why does the president need to be in the company of known terrorist supporters ?
and quit releasing prisoners , sending money overseas , etc
please rand , t ry and get on trump &apos;s cabinet to oversee waste !
oklahoma doesn &apos;t have very many immigrants .
let obama do his will .
why then , did you support the patriot act under bush ?
your comments are too little , too late ... paul ryan .
‚Ä¢ trump will end politicized doj , fbi , irs , etc .
congress seems unconcerned that obama hates the usa .
term limits and no pension for elected politicians !
utah has no oceanic ports yet texas does .
yes we will pray .
i love how impeachment comes up in every breath of so many anti-obama people .
i &apos;m glad you love your south carolina schools &apos; football teams .
great article in usa today rand !
the time for the rino is not now !
pro-life , pro-freedom , pro-states rights , libertarian style party .
the truth mr. edward bramley is that none of this is the governments business .
mccain war crimes are far greater than most people know .
we must take control if the senate and undo obamas damage
too bad georgia doesn &apos;t have a republican senator .
john mccain will always be a hero !
all policy issues aside , she is simply unqualified for this position .
the house should not pass any immigration bills .
sure paul message sent and congrats on 12 win !
marco you fooled me the first time and i voted for you .
final mr ryan
no taxes .
i am glad marco rubio humbled himself !
good questions , greg .
the constitution is not to be questioned or debated ... period .
c . 6 months is long enough .
go home marco .
wimps in washington they are no better than him
no budge !
thanks mia !
closing gitmo won &apos;t stop the terrorists from recruiting &amp; wanting to kill us !
you split the vote on the rnc now .
what an embarrassment to even consider not voting no on devos !
if they can &apos;t afford ins .
you &apos;re a day late and a dollar short chief .
what &apos;s with mitch mcconnel ? ? ?
i saw you , sen. cruz !
hell no ! ! ! !
what will the republicans do to stop this lawless , unconstitutional president ?
notice poe is for the most part staying away from that bs .
sell out lindsay s c needs to get rid of this career politician ..... .
we need more of the one &apos;s that will stand up for our constitution .
i voted # 41. god bless and prayers for a victory .
rand paul was my pick .
how much money did you receive from the devos family ?
that &apos;s why senate minority leader harry reid is endorsing him .
good , but not great repeal it .
obama has done nothing for this country .
now he funnels taxpayer dollars to our enemies of which he is one ! !
our constitution upheld .
close the embassies and bring all americans home if we have to .
let there be no government
s.c. deserves better .
he was wrong for what he did in charleston .
he is an oath keeper in the highest office in our nation !
it will stop obamacare in its tracks .
absolutely , the stand your ground law is basic common sense .
rand , why are they trying to incite war in america ? ?
carly is to the point and passionate .
replace majority leader in senate too !
glad to see a fiscal conservative in the peoples seat .
to have freedom you must have limits on that freedom .
balanced budget , spending cuts on failed programs
great briley richmond pass the buck is the norm .
are you at ron paul rally ?
however even w / that bush has come no where near obama &apos;s debt .
does anyone know when this clown is having town hall meeting ?
obama does nothing
why was there no fortifications and armed guards sent before the attack ?
70 % of the people do not want obama care .
i &apos;m not even from utah but i support you man !
we need conservative representation !
he wouldn &apos;t be cutting aid if the terrorist muslim brotherhood were still in charge
jesus is the definition of socialism .
the fact that harry reid keeps getting elected proves that .
is there some reason you can &apos;t impeach the potus ?
this is the # 1 issue with many conservative americans .
bring it on , rand ! !
the constitution says we have to pay the interest on the debt .
same contempt for constitutional limits on executive power .
but the rnc wants the practice to continue !
thanks , vern
we need someone like you in oklahoma .
thanks , lou !
you are telling me prayer is not working ?
hey mccain you should retire .
we , as american citizens , are obligated to defend the constitution over all .
under obama &apos;s leadership .
gowdy 4 president
4 gop censures for lindsey graham in 3 months j.mp / 17c61nx
a flat tax can be made fair using a graduating scale .
trey you are a real american .
i hope he makes a fool of you , rand .
praying for all this morning and through the day !
this is my feelings on rep. tom macarthur .
giving bo authority over the debt ceiling is unconstitutional ! !
the only thing i want to read is enzi not voting for bombing syria !
stop paying obama and his band of thieves
i stand with you rand paul .
you didn &apos;t mention the constitution .
mr ryan , to little too late to believe any thing you say .
they have proven time and time again that they cannot be trusted .
merry christmas &amp; god bless you &amp; yours .
tim scott is better person than you .
i can &apos;t think of anything scarier than obama with no oversight .
best regards , matt hoskins executive director senate conservatives fund
i am thinking i and we should have been listening to him
but , of course he now wants to release all of his homies
peter king traitor to the usa !
i am ashamed of the republican party as it now stands .
he said all along he would use the veto .
no and i am ready to denounce the republican party
my husband and i voted for you senator scott .
we must cleanse the gop of these spineless , &quot; moderate &quot; rinos .
i will either write in ben carson or i will vote libertarian .
now , what was your position on paul ryan and the continuing resolution ?
hell john mccain is so awesome , he should be president and vice president .
then went on to practice as a constitutional lawyer .
we need to bring back god into our country .
tom mcclintock , i see that your supporters are as stupid as you .
him twisting arms is exactly why you should have voted against him .
what about charges for lying to congress under oath ?
remove the dictator vote yes
good luck mr. graves and keep up the good work .
if you guys had impeached than she couldn &apos;t run for office .
no refugees please , let &apos;s try to keep tennessee free of terrorism
i think it &apos;s time for a man like ron paul .
i am just wanting tom mc to more accurately state the problem .
use our energy in this country , repeal obamacare and close the borders .
i mean besides support obama &apos;s muslim brotherhood ? ? ?
the republican party nationally is merely a shell of what it used to be .
prayers for our leaders and our nation
just like we don &apos;t negotiate with terrorist but obama did anyway !
question is , what are going to do about it ?
totally agree ... but the government has forgotten this truth .
is obama praying for america today ?
so why were the people who &apos;s ancestors fought under that flag being punished ?
poor john mccain - great american , but a pathetic beltway rino .
another impeachment process ?
prayers for mr. scott and his family so sorry for his loss
then i respectfully disagree with rand as well .
sometimes that will include giving aid to foreign nations .
www.exposingtrump.com could a true christian ever vote for donald trump ?
prayers sent brother .
behind you all the way ............ amen
paul , your fired !
he &apos;s a little late !
it is past time for him to resign .
i dont agree on the flat tax because example .
it &apos;s too late now .
obama will not .. he does what he wants to do w / o reguard
we know exactly what it was jerry .
please stand firm on us not getting involved in this mess .
tjdsnk ypi marsha .
my belief is that they all need to be replaced , including you scott .
where &apos; th political will to impeach that person in th whitehouse ? ?
impeach bo , he stinks
national guard and / or active duty military .
if this stands the government can then order you to purchase anything .
looking forward to seeing great strides toward a more fiscally responsible federal government .
very well said sir !
they all talk the talk .
what happened to your defense of the u.s constitution ?
shut the fascists reid and obama down ! ! !
trey gowdy for preident ! !
now we know he will not negotiate on obama care .
god bless you and your family .. üòá
the tsa has now gone from touching sensitive areas to totally screwing america .
they intimidated conservatives all over the country .
i hope ted realizes how much we watch his actions and his vote .
kill obama care now .
your establishment and chalkboard conservative created this mess .
he has ignored our nations constitution and left our men to die .
the president requested $ 4 b. you voted against it .
it &apos;s like obama is slapping the american people in the face !
brad , quit trying to pass the buck .
you have my sincere condolences , congressman blackburn .
so your so-called ta return problem is that romney files legal taxes ?
so , a &quot; balanced approach &quot; is higher taxes and lower spending .
no officer .
i miss jeb
merry christmas trey thanks for being you stand up justices
hope that trash angels enjoys jail
the obama sheeple voted for it , they got it .
rubio for president &apos; 16 !

john russell thinks you should consider another line of work .
your in george soros and obama &apos;s back pocket .
god bless those troops and their famlies who have fought for our freedom .
the fence riding gopers and rinos are waffling like a cadet on shore leave .
the federal government is flaunting deception right in our face .
yes , mr. president , i think you should take the blame .
he is no more concerned about defunding than the president or harry reid ! !
betsy devos is simply not qualified to lead the country in this position .
go get &apos;em enzi .
please , please listen to your constituents and country .
american &apos;s polititians can not keep spending money that they do not have .
kathleen you are the one that is full of ignorance if you like obama

and never try to make a living on internet sales or grandpa will tax ya

terrorists didn &apos;t bring those towers down trey ! !
you gave the jets to the muslim brotherhood in egypt .
but he keeps doing worse and worse taking away more of our freedoms .
i am imploring you to vote against betsy devos .
the president has done nothing but destroy our country from day one .
why wasn &apos;t he the nominee in 2012 ?
i can &apos;t believe how spineless these republican leaders are .

i &apos;m kind of disappointed , senator paul .
is rand paul turning into neocon ? ! ? ! ? ! ? !
please call for impeachment or trials for treason .
i am coming with u. i am switching to a libertarian
he hates a sovereign nation .
identifying himself with glenn beck might give him the wrong kind of puplicity .
close the boarders ... bring back our military ... protect our country .
no more government job , , , ever again ! ! ! ! !
how &apos;s that poker game ?
stand with cruz .
understanding the tea party patriot .
you are rolling over too mcclintock
gowdy for attorney general , please someone honest .
the american people are on to what obama is trying to .
we need real leadership in congress and he is not the answer .
sasse .
only fund obamacare to the $ $ $ obama said it would cost .
your vote for devos proved what we all have known .
he was right about obamacare .
traitor and liar
lindsey graham has go to go .
what scott does .
next stop needs to be the irs , epa , etc .
it &apos;s a little to late for your statement of support paul .
i hope you will be the old maverick john mccain .

that &apos;s the way a criminal would elude prosecution and in his case impeachment !
do something to stop it trey gowdy ! ! !
prayers lifted
jd hayworth was very anti amnesty .
laws that have not been read or voted on by either party .
i &apos;m more concerned with what you &apos;ll do to stop obama &apos;s lawlessness .
why do most people think that the republican party doesn &apos;t have a plan .
you should vote no !
obama has really tried his best to do good things for the nation .
mia love is class act !
what is this common sense alternative to obamacare ?
mr lankford it &apos;s called being a schizophrenic .
break it down , sen. scott !
true ... this is coming from mr. pauls office
i sooooo agree , mia ! !
uncle ben is here to help you -- # hail bernanke
that commendable mr. graham , but that does not pay my bills .
and obama wants it that way .
this agenda has been pushed since at least the reagan era .
i say to hell with them all - bp , obama and congress !
they do not know or care what we want anymore .
marsha blackburn we have 48 to defund obamacare .
we need security with the border .
scott the military needs to be paid .
i hope you &apos;ll vote &quot; no &quot; on besty devos .
thanks diane black , this law needs to be change asap
south carolina will be the only nudist state in the union !
give em hell tim
think about it , &quot; president marco rubio &quot; .
the only leadership he provides is for communist dictatorships .
reagan and george w bush .
that is what would happen if &quot; we the people &quot; lied to congress
i hope this committee has the authority to enforce the law .
so long rand not sure where your head is .
if they is no plan then we end up like presently .
flake you are a idiot !
no obama care , no amnesty for illegal foreigners .
where can we go to read the details of your proposal senator paul ?
mr poe this needs to stop
will you support articles of impeachment against the president ?
finally some spine is showing .
it appears that obama has lots of faith in susan rice .
this is the most unqualified candidate ever proposed for this office .
praying for all lost and our counrty .
thanks for selling out israel and the people egypt .
you need someone who understands these issues and that person is not devos .
this gentleman is obviously much smarter than the two senators he sent it to .
of s. c. i rely on sen. scott to rep. me .
we all remember the big hoopla about the irs scandal .
you have thousands of north carolinians who are telling you no to betsy devos .
he didn &apos;t even know he had been mentioned .
agree but make no mistake about it .
seriously people , stop it with the fair tax .
the epa is stopping the restoration of any forest fire !
praying for you and the few others who represent us well !
rand paul ! !
or no tax code .
why mr. isakson did you vote to cut pensions for our veterans ?
he uses the term isil as a slam to isreal .
the majority of the republicans in the house are no better than the liberals .
tim is there anything that can / will be done to stop iran ?
thank clinton for that and rino mccain time to retire you suck
no wonder we have no faith in our government .
excellent words mr. scott .
nuclear option ted !
senator mccain please show us your leadership .
please stand strong and please vote no !
get rid of common core and obama care .
boehner is why the gop has the largest house majority since 1920 ?
i am convinced his goal is to bankrupt / destroy our country !
you also voted for the tax increases and no spending cuts .
impeach obama so he and kerry can do no more damage .
he needs to be impeached and charged with treason as well .
lindsey , please reconsider .
there is something very very wrong with ted cruz -somthing very very strange !
congress got a raise .
mr. cornyn - respectfully , i feel this is total non-sense .
i believe most people would agree with that tax .
60 % of americans oppose .
nothing personal , i was considering rubio .
you think you are above us common folks and can not be held accountable .
call the white house at 1-866-285-5048 and demand the potus resign !
does anyone think that vern reads these comments ?
pray that god uses this resolution to make this a good ending .
gowdy is tops ! ..... with your moral fortitude ..... we can have hope !
easter blessings to you and your family , mr. rubio .
boehner is terrible and doesn &apos;t represent the people .
senator scott , what are you doing to stop this civil rights violation ?
no town hall meetings in years , no debates during election years .
johnny be good .
amen abba father .
but are they willing to override obama &apos;s automatic veto ?
impeach him if he does it
he set free south africans .
reagan cut taxes bush 1 was the one who raised them
trey says &quot; yes &quot; , i say &quot; yes &quot; !
republicans are not going to fix anything !
viva la paul !
praying you have wisdom !
you were supposed to be better than politics , paul ryan .
opportunistic rino .
you owe an apology to senator cruz and to the american people .
i am also writing trey gowdy .
ummmmmm , how did rand and jim vote on the 2013 ndaa ? ?
go tom go ! !
i like the house gop idea .
his freedom needs to be usurped , &amp; his right &apos;s &amp; benefits withdrawn !
you are so right , thanks mia !
help us mccain you &apos;re our only hope !
the senator is off base here .
so defund everything he wants to do that will send a strong mess
draft rand
the house was granted the power of the purse for this very reason .
stop talking about it and over ride it .
we came here from the cumberland of kentucky .
bout time you started doing your job johnny boy
my prayers are with the families , our country , and our leaders .
now congress can &apos;t ask her about benghazi .
what did harry reid know and how did he know it ?
some supporters of bruce also like and want to vote trump .
noah now paul ryan wants to grow a pair and back trump ?
you sir just sold out the education of children in nc and this country .
stand strong and vote no
i am with you tom .
he is after all the republican nominee .
no , cut the waist !
god bless you captain clay higgins .
please stand with lee and cruz !
may god and the usa always bless israel !
i expect that repealing aca will again make me ineligible to purchase insurance .
there is no accountability in our government !
why hell no ! ! !
good for ted poe .
it &apos;s amnesty that america can &apos;t afford , &quot; barletta said monday .
dear tom ,
hearts are hurting for our n. charleston family .
cindy and greg .
impeach the enemy ! !
and please stop sending money to other countries and groups esp .
he has always .. i don &apos;t get it ..
don &apos;t hold back ( punches ) , let the world hear the truth !
goodbye mitch .
neither are you marsha ... get a life !
100 % agree with you ben .
they could have withheld $ $ $ from obamacare , immigration , etc .
proud of mike lee from my home state .
our rep here in the first district is on obama &apos;s side .
oh i like trey gowdy but refuse to watch greta anymore .
help your constituents like barry did .
used to really like you mr. ryan but you &apos;re childish behavior changed that .
we need ted cruz 2016 ! !
scarred of the outcome and praying for this country .
good to know a republican majority is meaningless .
praying for gods comfort
and since the government built it , the government can shut it down .
replace the speaker .
wish more gop senators and congressman would do likewise .
because james bows his knee to the almighty god , the only true authority !
praying for this country .
listen to your constituents or kiss your senate seat goodbye !
cant wait for you to be potus ! ! !
mr. corker you realize that when you break it you bought it ?
another fake conservative outed !
we need a 3rd party to rise up .
what help do these policies bring to kansas low and middle-class tax payers .
at david , rubio voted against it .
somebody needs to hear from their mother .
no amnesty for criminals .
you cannot blame the senate for your extortion tactics .
you &apos;re an old fool john mccain .
how about some federal aid with those prayers !
oh yeah mitt romney .
this issue is &quot; red meat &quot; for the much more conservative base .
had no idea how beautiful southern utah is .
would vote for you or marco rubio for president .
immigration and obama care repeal all of it
louie gohmert !
no income tax at all , no irs .
godspeed brother
take the mic , mia !
close the border and enforce current immigration laws .
i am a voting republican voting 3rd party this year .
if you vote yes , we vote no during your reelection .
agree , tom mcclintock
ya , well a little to late for your weak , spinless vote .
i did not listen i don &apos;t want here his lies ! ! ! !
i am very disappointed in you senator , john mccain .
the founding fathers would have hung you for treason .
no taxes and such
patrick mulloy did you read the above link .
need to cut welfare programs , disability and medicaid .
secure the border first and send back each and every one of these illegals !
may god be with us in our time of need !
the answer has nothing to do with the constitution .
no american owes mr maxey anything !
i personally feel it violates our constitution and what america is all about .
the president insulted americans once more .
lack of compromise for the common good is more disappointing .
obama is a clueless amateur .
onlygod knows we need to some hard praying .
he is what a true christian man is .
the conservative heritage foundation came up with the concept of the individual mandate .
it just blew up in mccain &apos;s face !
i &apos;m stuck in your state too mr tom mcclintock tho different area .
betsy devos obviously does not .
obama is doing a lot of things bush did , like too much spending .
you were my guy , rand .
everyone needs to understand only god can save our country .
vote no and save time and money debating
you go mia , you are doing a great job
is lindsey getting a tad nervous ?
thats what i heard congressman
defund the beast !
i love try gowdy.i think he would be a fantastic speaker .
he released our enemies to free a deserter .
we are still hoping and praying that gitmo is not shut down !
mr. poe we need to talk .
can anyone in washington stand up for america ?
no congressman , we do not have a good deal !
harry reid said no
the proper place to contest a republican speaker is in the house republican conference .
please senator graham don &apos;t back down .... benghazi was a real tragedy .
marco rubio is a great example of what is wrong with washington .
we lift our leaders up in prayer
south carolina has had enough .
can obama be trusted for anything ?
biden is at least legally qualified to hold the office .
prayers for strength and condolences to senator scott !
i agree with bruce mccutcheon .
marco , why aren &apos;t the clintons weighing in on the mosque issue ?
devos is unqualified for this role .
3. is ben sasse hoping to be the 3rd party candidate ?
doesn &apos;t kansas have enough trouble with schools and education now ?
talk , talk , talk and no action - just like benghazi .
way to go judge robert shelby ! ! !
nice work bruce .
let freedom ring
when obama uses government resources to target his enemy list ?
praying for his family !
sen. mccain thanks for listening to me .
he has the courage to do the right thing and defund aca !
why did ted cruz enter the country illegally in 1974 ?
ron paul never sold us out .
he gave away any sense of honor years ago .
you sir , need to retire and let the government move on without you .
jerry moran , change your mind on your potential vote for betsy devos .
hang in there you are doing what we elected you for .
in god we trust not the government .
i wish it were you and not obama ! !
congress needs to be doing the job it was elected to do .
no we don &apos;t need to enforce the laws in place .
very little permanent jobs will be created .
greg charles
i &apos;ve taught in public schools in tennessee for almost 15 years .
congress only has itself to blame and only congress can fix it .
and stop sending money to other countries .
the economy only has gotten worse since obama
do you consider yourself the next ron paul ?
meeting our financial obligations by raising the debt limit shouldn &apos;t even be questioned .
i like john mccain as a person .
the new administration is doing its best to destroy this country .
@ joel - im a conservative .
why don &apos;t they do something about it ?
liberals want expanded government , conservatives want limited , constitutional government .
i am disappointed in your steadfast support of devos .
ted cruz is that candidate .
make him cut back on the expensive vacations
you need to get your story right and stop watching fox .
send him to gitmo and have a very long talk with him ...
congressman mcclintock supports ending the income tax !
pass the zadroga act for 9 / 11 first responders !
if not , mr. grassley needs to take some history courses .
stop spending .... reduce government
congress needs to move on impeachment of obama for his crimes against america !
together , they created obamacare .
praying for you &amp; your family .
so much for the pledge you all took to support the nominee .
fellow americans are our worst enemy .
betsey devos is unqualified .
john boehner has been speaker of the house for four years .
isn &apos;t there a republican in congress who is not afraid of obama ?
well trey gowdy we all know what &apos;s going on .
sorry rand you are all looking like fools ....
it &apos;s basically a who &apos;s who in the rino world .
he has several names , several countries he is a citizen of .
a big thanks to mitt romney .
i agree with ben sasse .
option b. the most active side of houston deserves it .
stand up for debt balance
about time sir
education is also very important to the cuban culture .
just like idaho education reform !
amen johnny - will you please be a leader for getting this done ! !
reid will sit on it and do nothing .
i with you on this we have fools in this administration of obama .
now get rid of him ....
she is beyond unqualified for this vital position .
mr. graham , i wholeheartedly support you and agree with your post .
reagan did executive orders but not on immigration .
you and lamar may be the only two in tennessee that support her !
obamacare is killing our economy and driving people into poverty .
trey is something special isn &apos;t he ?
so , what are y &apos;all going to do about it ?
ron paul and massie on our ballot today
too bad obama can &apos;t stop campaigning and put a budget in place .
prosecute obama and clinton for benghazi deaths ! ! ! ! ! !
hands off syria and stop supporting terrorist in our country ..
absolutely on point , congressman mike coffman .
so much for obamacare .
and you will not be able to get enough votes to overturn the veto .
will they once obamacare is fully implemented ?
just because they aren &apos;t from kentucky doesn &apos;t mean they &apos;re less important !
i am against this nomination and ask you to reconsider .
cut foreign aid and use our money here on the homefront !
merry christmas mr trey gowdy
the president should be held accountable .
why are we selling arms to anyone ?
reduce spending , cut taxes , lessen government regulations on business , impeach obama .
i sure hope and pray something can be done to stop that .
obama wont want to stop arming his muslim brotherhood friends .
no .. that is what obama care is gonna cost us !
a clean cr with no amendments should be passed immediately .
i glad he vetoed it
you can &apos;t cut the budget .
do not impeach , arrest this administration !
abolish the income tax , then watch what happens .
they are mad cause you are standing up for us and whats right ! !
we have a revenue problem , caused by a spending problem ..
no compromise rand !
maybe jimmy graham can secure the border !
it is time to impeach him !
right but it all started in egypt
where &apos;s reagan when we need him ? ?
in your name , we pray and ask , amen .
no common core ! !
johnny isakson is so correct .
vote no is a hell of a way to go
that is always our goal for all our students in south carolina .
trey , you are the man !
i want to see sasse wearing his im with her button .
we are keeping her in our prayers
where were you when we needed you - too little tooo late
obama is going to pardon anyone who is convicted before he leaves office .
we will take america back and abolish the federal reserve too !
that &apos;s because the president is a muslim terrorist himself .
bravo congressman dave reichert _ hope you make for a run for the senate !
go james go ! !
corker is a far - right fanatical conservative .
patrick iannuccilli , in my estimation , they should have never stopped the draft !
well said bruce akins
constitutionalists / conservatives have no representation in washington .
democrats are hoping rand paul runs for potus too .
trey gowdy for supreme court ! !
why didn &apos;t you impeach obama , hillary when they let americans die .
i agree , billy bob .
and , please read your emails .
shouldn &apos;t the fed gov just stay out it ?
come on , tom !
obama does so , and america &apos;s in danger !
you better stop this illegal , dangerous traitor !
indeed , senator crapo has taken ~ $ 320,000.00 from big oil .
and it should definitely not take precedent over having a qualified secretary of education .
he hasn &apos;t hosted any real town hall meetings .
the house would carry for impeachment .
thanks mia , but watch your back .
how does spending and big government , debt help our future and children ?
get rid of these terrorist .
fora obama
no sir , the major issue is the budget .
mr. graham , i &apos;ll take that a step further .
mccain , you are a rino ...
doesn &apos;t america need this foreign aid money now !
our insurance plan was fantastic until obamacare !
does bringing the country together mean obama care ?
congrats mr. scott .
sounds like you are kissing azz marsha .
amen and god bless .
you are a true disappointment sen rubio .
so now funding is allowed to be used to enforce regulations ?
diane black is on the losing side of history ... again !
neo-con who is a liberal in a rino &apos;s clothing !
is harry reid running the senate again ?
you should run , senator scott .
today a 4th generation north carolina us citizen carpenter is working in my house .
he needs to enforce the immigration laws !
judge roberts got it right !
that &apos;s big of you paul .
that &apos;s good to know senator tillis ! !
don &apos;t let these establishment republicans fool you , vote trump
obama wins nothing here in kentucky ! !
and he stands for principles .
senator isakson , i saw you in the crowd ! !
mia , you are breath of fresh air ...
congress must be held accountable for upholding the constitution .
devos is incompetent ! !
unless you want the kremlin determining our foreign policy ...
no theresa , he is .
impeach .... take away all his power ! ! !
please help us senator graham !
time to stop blaming bush people !
you are the only republican that should be nominated .
and obama hates the colonial nation of america .
begin by impeaching the so called president obama ! !
whatever will happen , we stand with rand paul .
prayers sent for all !
i pray there aren &apos;t any mysterious plane crashes in the paul &apos;s future .
yourself , senator paul and commissioner comer get a big thumbs up from me .
no way stand strong .
no doubt in my mind you will be the potus one day !
you need to represent the people of tennessee .
yea jesus
excellent idea , mr. lindsey .
your number one and only priority should be impeachment
neither will your immigration bill !
glad to here that you are keeping our military paid .
you are basically saying the government is against the american people ?
the vice president and i are both resigning immediately .
congrats mia , from texas
happy thanksgiving trey ü¶É üçÅ ü¶É
prayers to the sc community !
nancy reagan welcome home you are with our lord and president reagan
congressman mike pompeo has taken the right stand .
i thought i knew trey gowdy but that one threw me .
that will change the dynamics on obamacare .
u need to secure the border .
&quot; not enough cuts &quot; there are no cuts !
too many people have destroyed the republican party .
our southern family and died for that flag .
if grimes gets in there we don &apos;t stand a chance ! !
i hope we clean house in 2014 and get all the dirtbags out .
it &apos;s called articles of impeachment for treason .
as much as you know about obama why is he still in the whitehouse ?
he wants to be a ruler not a president .
we need to impeach this president .
good for you johnny and good for america .
senator ted cruz needs to be stopped .
no one has or can stop him !
i highly doubt if mr. mcclintock will ever get the answer to that question .
we need our congress to stand up for us .
when are we going to impeach his sorry hide ?
its obvious he is trying to fix the country .
shouldn &apos;t impeachment occur ?
then conference on a long term debt resolution .... that order .
gee john you &apos;ve been in dc how long ?
amen ! ! &quot;
y &apos;all ran for what you believe in and got elected because of it .
let &apos;s hope so james .
nor can vern
a formal apology and a resignation
run for president , senator thune !
obama doesn &apos;t need any help looking weak .
&apos; n god bless you &amp; your family !
tim and charla seem to ignore their parties enormous spending and lack of accountibility .
keep fighting the good fight rand .
go further and impeach trump or declare him unfit .
just secure our borders please ! !
cuba is not drilling in us waters .
while i support ending the aca , i oppose defunding planned parenthood .
seems like ur the only one that wants to answer questions .
stop paying federal taxes !
rand come i love your politics , and defense of the constitution .
why does obama think he can regulate the internet ?
a vote for cloture is a backhanded vote for obamacare !
god bless you , tim and sue ... have a wonderful thanksgiving ! !
those who give up freedom for security , soon end up with neither .
tom mcclintock is lying to us , 24 / 7 .
1988 remember your history mitch .
defund the bill that nobody read until after it was passed .
try him for treason for not upholding his oath of office .
while i &apos;m at it ... defund obamacare !
he &apos;s done nothing but run this country in the ground .
i hope that you mean that , mr. ryan .
you guys have become a joke .
no responsibility will be assigned , and none will be taken .
allowing funding for obamas illegal actions is a waste of tax payer money .
when did this become a conservative value ?
now on to immigration and boehner wanting to go along with it .
geeeeeeze louise , tom .
now our representatives are standing by watching all of our freedoms denied !
merry christmas to you mr trey gowdy !
where were all the white southern congressmen back then ?
impeach this imposter , this hater of america !
to date there is no gop plan .
havent heard what johanns did bet he sold us out but havent heard
good interview rand !
1 ) repeal and replace obamacare .
instead of worrying about taxing the rich tax himself to lower our debt !
obamacare is here to stay as long as he is president .
please we need a real conservative in the senate !
something should be done or organized to win our country and constitution back !
ted , you were only going to washington for 1 term .
we need to get rid of obamacare !
secondly , james asked us for our opinion , and we obliged him .
increased market share has absolutely nothing to do with increased demand .
option a. they &apos;ve screwed up enough of houston with that boondoggle .
this would for all practical purposes empty wash dc and shut down the government .
get this law repealed and obama impeached please .
yes , god bless america and a special salute to our armed forces .
rand paul 2010 , ron paul 2012
the president was wrong to bypass congress as he done before .
screw you and john boehner .
waiting and watching on fox news
god bless usa ! !
better not cut too much funding to the usgs .
tom , shut up ! ! ! ! !
the constitution is at stake .
go rand goooo
i pray it does .
were with you rand .
prayers for his family üôè
still love you praying gods favor all over you !
great announcement not discussion ; u the man
our president doesn &apos;t stand for any strong or proud american values
did mr chaffetz vote to cut embassy security ?
tom this president is going to continue until a civil war breaks out .
i have yet to see any dems do anything to cut spending .
yes , but you will not do anything about it - just hot air
i voted for you tim .
well i think you have to start with jesus .
any idea on how fema aid will be considered for small businesses ?
that he &apos;s resigning and going back to his birth place , kenya ! !
cut spending and stop asking for still more money to waste !
we need true conservatives in the leadership of our party .
as a conservative , i &apos;m not sure why that would be the case .
it is not the number of executive orders -- it is what he has done
and mccain too .
may god bless you and our great country - ltc kim chaney , us army
i &apos;m sure that the irs has policies about how long backups are kept .
john thune , you are a good man .
love you rand paul !
hope that &apos;s soon tom !
obviously rand you haven &apos;t been listening ? ? ?
obama is simply a sadist .
we are watching and understand what voting for cloture means .
it should have been repealed before it took affect .
get rid of barry aka obama .
sounds like anothe fast and furious .
hannity just reported that our spending has jumped 19 % since obama took office .
how about impeaching obama ?
nope , not mourning someone who was a marxist communist terrorist .
i agree government needs to be reduced
impeach that commie , congressman !
love mr scott too !
not repeal and replace .
submit legislation to defund the epa and eliminate it as a federal program .
disappointed in this vote sir .
sen. mccain is awesome !
i &apos;m embarrassed to even think that i believed you were a conservative !
we will pray for you and your family .
what can you expect from the biggest joke ever pulled on american people !
people don &apos;t like obama &apos;s policies ! !
what kind of stupid is obama ! !
amen saudis arabia sounds good to me .
happy thanksgiving mr mccain from the middle east .
the only traitors are in the administration and white house .
no authori-tie !
stick a fork in obama , he &apos;s done !
government is not the answer if it ain &apos;t broke don &apos;t fix it !
the whole republican party is disgusting .
citizen arrest this traitor obama !
i am an independent conservative .
where is the petition : republicans to impeach the president ?
i have never believed anything this administration has said from day one .
bottom line the games in dc have to end !
get rid of obamacare .. reduce taxes !
start with the rand paul budget plan ; obama will summarily reject it .
we love you mia
be scared you traitor to the constitution .
we are tired of the lindsey grahams and the other politicians .
maybe we need a wacko bird to lead this country ?
he will just do what he always does blame bush
monkeys all of them , see no evil hear no evil speak no evil .
if we impeach harry reid that would be a great start
this is exactly why many of us wanted a new speaker .
i actually went to a performance today at the northeast florida conservatory .
raising the debt ceiling only opens the door to more rampant and reckless spending !
go to cuba if you want obamacare .
can &apos;t wait for rubio 2016 ! ! ! !
stop backing o &apos;bama &apos;s spy plan .
there should be no cr in the first place .
anyone for an impeachment hearing ?
they are leading to follow greece &amp; spain down the rat hole .
sir , you are stating a bill to defund pp can &apos;t be blocked .
the people of tn are saying no to devos .
why won &apos;t trey run for president
boehner paid him off .
obama sheep say worship him !
another good question from you rand !
here is an example of our tax system .
go jerry .
marco , i voted for you on super tuesday .
you need to be clear and not let obama make his own illegal laws .
he has done anything but bring down this great country .
stop being an obstructionist , mitch .
sir , you are blessing to so many .
mia for president ... seriously .
don &apos;t try to ever tell me about being a fiscal conservative .
it sound like the corker bill will play right into obama &apos;s hand .
hope you can help tim .
better yet , how will this administration get away with this ! ! !
good , you &apos;ve been mia for your people for a long time .
i suppose fox has got you lamebrains scared shitless of isis .
loving the points you and senator cruz are making .
holder to be impeached .
mccain the shit
good luck mia , from mayville , wisconsin .
the constitution is under attack .
you were ok with bush using drones to kill people .
denise b. is correct .
they have behaved as enemies of the constitution .
represent the grass roots and don &apos;t cave in when the crazies start complaining .
don &apos;t forget benghazi and the americans that were given no help .
ditto kenny
it is unfortunate the executive branch is devoid of that trait .
impeach obama - enough is enough
if trey gowdy steps up he would be great too .
chris christie is drinking the kool aide . &quot;
nebraska got illegals from mexico , and gov .
more government waste of our tax dollars ! ! !
next , cut spending back to pre-obama levels .
impeach this scoundrel !
thx marsha ! !
then go to work and be a good little marco
obama &apos;s not clueless , he knows exactly what he &apos;s doing .
obama is funded by iran .
that &apos;s 100 percent why all true conservatives should get behind trump .
congress and the president need to stop harassing us .
praying for his family and friends !
i would suggest a fair tax .
i &apos;ll be watching in north carolina .
thanks for your service sir .
she is absolutely unqualified to be secretary of education .
this is exactly why i voted for you sir
do not rely on conservative news sources to tell your story .
stop the treasury from monetizing the debt .
susie flaherty , going over the cliff would have been even better for obama .
israel needs to turn mossad loose on him !
i &apos;m praying for an arrest before tuesday .
ha ha ha your a little late to the party .
you are only in office because the oklahoma public is so pathetically apathetic .
support defunding / postponing obamacare .
a vote for obama in 2012 was a vote for obamacare .
mr king you are a pig
john mccain ... you must vote no on devos .
no way can i vote for the communist / socialist party .
our government is just plain stupid ! ! !
we don &apos;t need another kay hagen

i am sick of our government ruining our country .
* * * notice the section &apos; unprepared or unqualified .

bush has the stones obama lacks .
it is suicide to pay to bring the enemy to america .
merry christmas marsha .
what the hell is wrong with you mccain
cindy , you nailed it when you said congress has no backbone .
at least a 10 % reduction in the government spending .
repealing or improving it is .
congress needs to start standing up to this terrorist we call president .
why would anyone care what rand paul says ?
i demand we revoke obama immediately
i can , he is a traitor !
i speak as one of your sc constituents .
wish mediacom provided fox business channel
i &apos;m in for flat or fair tax .

bruce accuses his emily of having a liberal voting record .
his policies are doing exactly what he has planned .
you lost my ear john mccain .
don &apos;t want the enemy messing with our ally
i think it &apos;s time tennessee drained its swamp .
mccain is jealous of your successful filibuster .
you signed grover norquist &apos;s taxpayer protection pledge dave .
the constitution states that the sitting pres nominate a replacement .
time for some checking as there is no balance right now .
they continue to knowingly support the obama lies .
the president can veto the wishes of 535 members of congress .
where &apos;s ole sam adams when we need him again .
i think it is past time ti impeach the president .
again tim the athiest is thanking god .
you talk about being against obamacare , but you proved otherwise with your actions .
trey gowdy or louie gomert for speaker .
no , repeal it !
no balanced budget amendments or so-called strong reforms will justify raising it .
mccain would have opposed thatcher the entire way .
obama hasn &apos;t helped with anything but creating more problems ! !
congress needs to raise tax rates for the wealthy .
reagan definitely
i will vote for the libertarian party candidate in the general election .
standing with you rand .
no constitutional right is absolute .
f , obama
obamacare will shutdown america and the hope of reviving our constitutional republic .
is it that good lee
why did they fail to raise the debt ceiling during that time ?
kentucky is looking better all the time .
i respectfully disagree with you and hope you will reconsider your support for her .
amazing , senator graham your comment was completely neutral all the way through .
nicely said mr. george chase !
getting aid to invaders is treason .
have you ever heard of veto .
i plead with you to rethink your support of betsy devos .
we &apos;re proud of ya rand .
please note that the &quot; beloved &quot; ronnie reagan raised the debt by 186 %
way to go senator isakson .
amen i agree
true conservatives are behind you , rand !
: - / no how about voting to shut down obamacare and stop amnesty !
it &apos;s crippling and our tax dollars are just funding these leeches .
so , how stupid does the admin .
you are so right tom mcclintock ...
rand i have a new name for you a tea party thug .
if its unlawful then stick it to him .
you are a great leader senator mccain .
bring some sense to our government !
disillusioned , disgusted and furious .
we can &apos;t throw him out of office or undo the last election .
stop withdrawing your support speaker paul ryan
paul ryan are you insane ?
i have had enough of socialist lite .
reagan said &quot; trust but verify . &quot;
we the people deserve truth by our elected officials .
i know this isn &apos;t easy , but the lord has gone before you .
congratulations &amp; god bless you !
yes , i believe obama definitely has us on the wrong track !
you marsha blackurn ! what are you prepared to do about it !
carson / cruz
house determine what money is spent ... responsible for paying for all obamas illegal activities
thank god that we have a true conservative like dean representing us in nv .
no i am not a right wing conservative .
he would make a fantastic speaker .
30 cent tax .
her next project is to repeal obamacare and investigate benghazi benghazi benghazi benghazi !
for quite a few years you &apos;ve been talking about repeal and replace .
i believe you are correct james .
wow mitch mcconnell really ?
i will never agree with mccain on anything he says .
guess you are a day late and a dollar short .
you will not receive my vote because we got nothing out of this .
and when are y &apos;all going to start ?
i &apos;m sure harry reid supports this common sense bill .
sam , you are a great disappointment , you should resign !
the government should stay away from education .
please impeach him and biden .
merry christmas to the paul family !
aca isn &apos;t worth default and or crippling the recovery such as it is .
you should have been there from the start .
your way or the highway and no compromise
he is bypassing congress since his ideas will not float there .
praying for you during this difficult time .
please continue to uphold american principles and the constitution !
mr. scott !
2 ) can they continue spending , if the debt ceiling isn &apos;t lifted ?
fire obama would be a great start
obama being arrested for treason sounds about right .
help our kids by getting the government out of education .
you are going into the lions den ... will be praying for you !
thanks guys and thanks rand paul !
teachers deserve more respect than mrs. devos wants to give us .
america wants the irs gone ! ! !
this is not the libertarian way .
are you running these illegals out of sc yet ?
good job thom tillis
shut the thing down and get the disaster repealed
its about getting back to the one true god the us was founded on .
none of you have the guts to remove your boss .
tell boehner to wake up .
essentially you voted to keep obama care ! !
maybe confirm a more qualified candidate next time instead of listening to your wallet .
you &apos;re a liar just like obama .
so you only support the constitution when the constitution supports you .
paul ryan does not represent me .
we have taxed enough and now lets cut spending .
lets cut the foreign aid and let them hate us for free .
you should have let obama shut down the government !
given that the senate has passed no budget in 4 years .
no big surprise and so well said , mr .
emily cain has never held a job let alone create one
well lindsey , you got caught with your pants down .
amen brother hatch .. now get the budget under control .
give federal land back to the states as required by the enabling acts .
would love to get gas tax back to state administration rather than fed .
most of the republican party leadership repudiated him this weekend .
james is just what we need .
so obama wanted to gut the military .
defund the un and kick them out of our country .
anyways , god bless you mr. paul gosar .
florida just went over to the obama column with the announcement .
i believe that impeachment starts in the house .
the republicrats are our enemies .
just keep washington shut down it the best thing for the country
turns out chris christie is a turncoat !
no war ! !
god bless you and prayers for wisdom , strength and courage .
cruz , rubio , carson
they should not be crossing our borders in the first place .
you go rand , keep it up !
bring on the fair tax !
listen to your constituents , mr. corker , not your banker .
go tom go ! ! !
i am beginning to have serious reservations about sen isakson .
the point of printing money is to create demand by spending it .
don &apos;t blame the insurance companies , blame obama .
so was that the conservative through &amp; through way ?
why can &apos;t we stop the spending ?
the republicraps sold us out long ago .... trey gowdy is wasting our time .
i love you john mccain even though this bill is a crock .
impeach obama , jail hillary !
congress and house , please take obama &apos;s credit card from him
i &apos;m sorry senator mccain .
the alex jones guy is the media he cant just say stuff .
does this mean i can &apos;t write in marco for president ?
how about you and your supporters focus on the real enemy rand ?
sorry phyllis epa can go to hell !
love you mr gowdy !
please do not vote for kevin mccarthy for speaker of the house .
i agree , maybe they need someone with some common sense up there .
just get rid of obama
use prism to kick the illegals out .
electing boehner was the right move .
you would have my vote , too , sen. thune , if you run .
put the whole obama admin in jail ! ! ! !
paul ryan - you &apos;re a sell-out too üëπ
you had a funded government that defunded obamacare and you turned it down .
mr. gowdy i love u man keep up the good work

thanks tim you are awesome ! ! !
obama had to clean the mess bush left .
lead for one time obama .
support the people , support the constitution !
&quot; no budget , no pay &quot; \
republicans begin to fold on scalia &apos;s replacement after just 2 days rushlimbaugh.com

i agree with paul .. not obama !
what a traitor you are to this wonderful republic !
i never thought in tn our kids education would be for sale .

mr. gowdy please please pretty please run for the presidential office !
this both is a revenue problem and a legal problem in fair taxation .
it is no surprise he acts like he could care less .
mr. graham , you have lost your way .
send a message during the republican primary and vote him out .
or can the next administration take it on and finish cleaning up the mess ?
dhs would continue to function on a limited basis .
bit by bit the liberal commies are assaulting our bill of rights .
please quit now johnny , you &apos;ve done enough damage to our constitution !
how about co sponsoring the impeachment of calif ali ben obooboo ?
wow ted !

obama has promised to veto the pipeline .
i am with you senator scott .
he should have been on a plane back to dc .

ndaa &amp; the patriot act , both passed and both violate the constitution .
not like holding holder accountable .
isnt it called treason when u go aginst the us constution just asken ?
yes i believe israel is justified
same one , mia .
the gop has done nothing to creat the jobs they promised .
thanks paul ryan ..... for nothing !
lol , how did mitch keep you down and uneducated ?
it &apos;s time for articles of impeachment to be brought against him .
end federal income tax and do away with the irs

you are letting harry reid win .
meantime mr mccain was wonderful christmas in aleppo right ?
good job ya &apos;ll
a vote for cloture was a vote for obamacare .
this bill raises revenue and it did not originate in the house .
no innocent until proven guilty for her !
you &apos;re no better than obama , or mccain .
do what we sent you there to do ! !
don &apos;t ever quit sen. graham , we need you
her yes vote is a vote for full funding of amnesty &amp; obamacare .
artie , beware of anything mike huckabee says .
would rather have you with the troops than with obama and beyonce .
things won &apos;t improve until obama is gone !
he just thinks the american people are stupid .
it is time someone stood up for the people of this country .
the flat tax needs to be a true flat tax .
then get busy jerry and cut off the funding .
liberty for all ! !
you voted yes on cloture with full understanding of what it meant .
no american should not intervene leave it alone
we have traded liberty for chains and slavery .
can &apos;t have the obamas living any where but the best
love u johnny !
i think egypt got the solution right .
mr ryan thanks k you for showing grace .
happy birthday ms. marsha .
he has not once put our national security interest first .
no option my lord .
no earmarks , then defund obama &apos;s pet &apos;s - simple ! !
marsha , we appreciate the work you are doing !
zadroga act needs to be renewed and made permanent .
pool boy rubio never represented the people of florida .
i didnt mean to imply attacking you , lord no !
i &apos;m glad i voted for you rep. paul gosar
repeal : obamacare , dept of education , defund npr and eliminate overlapping agencies .
so you want our tax dollars to go to foreign farmers ?
this idiot is an embarrassment to south carolina .
at least he has the courage to try to fix the mess .
go get em sen. dr. paul ;
the bill that obama threatened to veto .
you only have a few months with him left before he is gone !
i can &apos;t wait for the scott brown / john thune ticket !
it &apos;s frightening that our government would even consider arming our enemy .
mr. trump is good ... but mr. marco rubio is great ! !
i imagine it will boost gop votes in november instead .
i pray everyone hears him !
hoping and praying uncle virgil is going to ace his surgery !

reid would not let them be voted on .
no where in the constitution does it state that .
merry christmas to you and yours sir !
you are wonderfully conservative and sane in an insane , liberal world .
john mccain please keep standing up to this president and his orders .
obama has been guilty of treason many times in my eyes .
there should be a way to veto his veto
just run for speaker already
he is as bad as mccain or mcconnel .
you , mcconnell , graham and other republican establishment types are out of touch .
god bless you and your family and god bless the usa .
throw all the bums out .
he did vote no so did cruz and lee .
christie is an obama cheerleader .
obama will never be transparent .
i wish we had more leaders like you and senator graham .
george soros , the fed !
i think a libertarian wrote it .
1 ) secure the border better .
i like the idea of residency but no citizenship if they came here illegally .
mr. hatch do not vote for this ! ! ! ! ! !

local authority and responsibility wins out over centralized authority eevery time in every inatance .
rand i will listen
bo should be impeached over this travesty and also for fast and furious .
why didn &apos;t ben sasse run for president ?

i think you have no clue how intrusive gov .
join in with cruz and kill all the gun bans in the total country
i also think susan rice should be fired .
rand its your turn
mcclintock : another corporate owned empty suit .
there is no leadership in congress right now on either side .
i would have preferred cruz but he &apos;s out .
bring it on ryan
no confidence in this president to look after the well being of the citizens .
the gop is responsible for this mess .
they are in our prayers daily .
not raising the debt ceiling will not cause a default !
reagan was a true wise man .
enact the same on in florida .
look toward a flat tax then you could eliminate half of the irs .
been too much of him too long already !
... and that &apos;s how we got obamacare .
stay tough senator cornyn .
it is the ideology of our terrorist enemy that must be destroyed .
immediate impeachment should follow .
time for mccain to retire without pay .
oh and mr. ryan , trump has no baggage or scandal ?

we need more people like bruce to be on top of issues ! !
5. america sanctioned cuba which proved to be useless .
sasse needs to remember we elected him and he needs to hear our voices .

burr didnt stand for the 2a , and he voted for internet tax .
you made fun of cruz .
the president has not dismissed isis .
nice talking point , tim .
obama care failed because stupid republican states refused to chip in their parts .
he &apos;s resigning ! ! !
cruz is an idiot .
you got that right rand .
its time to ween americans off the nipple of uncle sam .
brian -- mr williamsburg ohio : , rand is actually leading polls .
mr. lankford , you got my vote today .
i expect congress to be a check and balance on the executive branch .
i had high hopes for rand paul for president but now i must reconsider .
we must stand up for liberty .
thom i agree with you ...
obama has been held accountable for nothing !
devos is grossly inexperienced and unqualified for this position .
so what are you doing to stop king obama ?
yea rand paul ! ! ! ! !
congratulations , senator rand paul ! !
appearantly us electing lindsay didn &apos;t have that same consequence .
# standwithrand # letranddebate or # boycottdebate
do not let obama keep spending .
you have represented the great state of georgia with disgrace and shame .
i love what bruce poliquin stand for .
obama and kerry committed treason .
what is the debt ceiling ?
happy and blessed easter tim !
stop chipping away at are freedoms .
is the fox poll rigged ?
keep strong god bless .
um ..... i can &apos;t remember the last time congress listened to the people .
obstruction , thy name is mitch .
o hell no
reagan was not liked by the media then or now .
marco , what are your views on illegal immigrants ?
thanks scott you are doing a fine job
best of health to the gowdy clan .
bush left office with iraq secure .
he should have planned it better
no one can override the constitution , not even in the future .
merry christmas dr .
pos just like his butt sniffing buddy mccain .
is this not an impeachable offense ? !
it is our duty to fix this government
here plenty talk no action
well done kentucky !
very disappointed in your decision to back devos .
why are you detroying the govenrment based on the constitution and replacing it ?
god bless you and your family , trey gowdy .
i think article 5 is there so that we can amend the constitution .
from recent history , jerry , neither can god .
don &apos;t get caught up in big government bureaucracy .
you and ron paul are truly defenders of liberty .
i support trey gowdy for majority leader !
tim i think you need to do a little research before you post comments .....
he says our constitution &apos; &apos; constrains &apos; &apos; him ? ? ?
lets talk about the illegals crossing our borders .
betsy devos is unqualified for this office and you know it .
to obama put holds on immigration from countries ?
this revolution talk is crazy .
you agreed to support the nominee .
but you are not any better than paul ryan .
we have mr. o that does too much of that .
cutting government spending on salaries alone will save a trillion dollars .
they only pay little tax .
ted poe for speaker of the house
congressman lankford , do you even listen to your people ?
besides voting obama out of office our hands are tied .
stop talking and fix the problems !
shannon is a rino !
obama is a loser !
a flat tax is the only fair way to go .
it shouldn &apos;t be &amp; there should be no questions !
i know he wouldn &apos;t associate with a guy like romney .
we should hand illegals for a week and see how many come back .
god bless and much respect !
no backbone !
i &apos;ve heard that boehner is actually siding with reid on this .
your job is to represent all wyoming citizens .
you are a disgrace to the republican party and the morals of our country .
killing our enemies abroad is the answer .
our nation needs prayer now by everyone
he acted like a little kid at the debate calling cruz liar , liar .
house leader needs to compromise with his own party .
disappointed in my gop---time for a new republican party !
but you will still stick it to us while you are in there .
harry reid is sending out all those lying adds about tillis .
im disgusted with you sir !
just met mr. lankford in harrah .
rand paul / peter schiff 2012 .
texas , our texas !
i am so disappointed in john mccain and jeff flake .
i want you to be speaker instead of boehner .
mr. mcclintock , did you vote for the current budget ?
you should not be rewarded for breaking the law period ! ! !
devos is totally unqualified and you knew it but you voted for her anyway .
i &apos;m guessing he &apos;s probally a rino also .
this is great congressman lamborn , but where will the funding come from ?
sir , the debt is no problem to obama .
the nea opposes devos .
i am a georgia voter that will actively campaign for your opponent !
he has done nothing against the law .
prayers for all involved
i also wonder why we have not impeached obama ?
whose medical insurance is going up so high because of obamacare ?
marco come back we need you there &apos;s still time .
so long as he continues persuing the truth in the benghazi hearing !
bullshit , talk to ted cruz about it
mia we want you to vote no to h.r.
bob corker - shame on you .
senator rand your so out of touch !
cut the big spending .
now we just have to rebuild everything that obama has destroyed ..
no aca
liberty for all life .
you &apos;re an idiot paul ryan .
it really is in your hands senator moran .
nothing can replace mom .
america is no longer safe because of obama refusing too secure our borders !
congratulations , you have no backbone and you , sir , are a sellout .
well said tim .
please vote no on the tax bill unless it has spending cuts
i think jack is john mccain &apos;s son .
the regime will be gone in 2012 ! !
paul ryan can you hear us ?
however , ms. roby has a very clear stance on immigration issues .
kudos to you sir for keeping up the fight ! !
rand you need to address what is happening in nevada and mr .
prayers
i do know that ms. devos is not qualified to be secretary of education .
obama is destroying our constitution and i reckon we r allowing it .
excellent choice , tim ! !
kaki paul
awesome interview is right !
the question is , what do you think and what is the plan ?
what it looks like when a republican makes sense .
kick his butt sir
sorry tom at this point i trust the russians more than our government .
lindsay it &apos;s not working .
hey glenn , without marsha blackburn you would be paying a state income tax !
of course , he wants us to have all that free technology .
love me some marsha blackburn
keep doing what you are , tom
how right u are lee
stop devos from dismantling the public schools .
ask roy barnes what happens when ga educators mobilize .
when are you guys on the hill going to get it figured out .
we like marco rubio .
rubio 2016 gives me hope !
congress needs to stand up to the president and holder .
you sir , are a lying sack of !
amen mr. zeldin !
do not confirm betsy devos for secretary of education .
the obama administration is absolutely lawless and has to be called out .
i hope we will be rid of obama care soon .
we need to form a new republican party with rand as our leader .
he has several offenses that could earn him impeachment .
this time it is to suspend obamacare till next year .
the next thing they will take will be all the confederate monuments .
i agree with you senator graham .
the koch baby , marsha
the constitution also provides an exception to this process .
aren &apos;t there already syrians here &amp; scheduled to be in middle tn soon ?
note for mr. cruz - slap !
what stupid obama can &apos;t grasp .
when will obama be impeached ?
you and senator ted cruz have my vote .
why do liberals hate the founding fathers and the constitution ?
he &apos;s committed enough to be impeached plus brought up on charges !
i &apos;m so sorry james .
we &apos;re praying for and supporting the cuts you need to make .
obama has done it his way from the beginning !
independence and liberty are what we need most .
still need five more votes to overcome a presidential veto
sorry congressman , i don &apos;t trust your no vote for a second !
thanks tom rice for nothing !
too late to start sucking up now lindsey .
repeal everything that this administration has done over the last five years .
impeach the potus ! !
# endthefuckery # worstresponders keep your word mitch mcconnell !
love you , tim .
hope jindal does well in the coming months also .
the cave session of last night was utterly sickening .
james , what are your thoughts on the parliamentary system ?
i don &apos;t like obama but what are you doing for your constituents locally ?
he is doing what we elected him to do .
paul ryan you are the biggest pussy on the face of the earth .
exactly senator rubio !
we got your back here in ga .
some of us rino &apos;s are pure conservatives
come see me in perry , lynn .
mia , i think defunding was tried already .
why do you mr shuster support indefinite detention of american citizens ?
i am sure you will fall in line and vote for paul ryan .
and congress is letting him get away with it ! !
fu fred .
hope you stand up for american people and vote against amnesty
run for president will you please mr .
now let &apos;s start impeachment proceedings on the entire administration !
you people making all these negative comments are stupid and probably voted for obama .
see paul your part of the gop establishment that we can &apos;t stand !
linsey graham , i admire you so much !
the people of tennessee will remember how you voted against our children .
have the military secure our borders .
293 days and not even a hearing for merrick garland ?
glass : egypt and mesopotamia
as usual federal government bureaucracy fails again.impeach bo now
ty bruce
if anything it should have been a 1 to 1 swap .
obama is still president because ?
now obama threatens to veto it .
you shouldn &apos;t get a salary period !
i love the marco rubio story .
reagan and or jefferson
don &apos;t play political games about repealing it later .
marco , .
godspeed trey gowdy ... may justice prevail ... citizens all ...
get to work stopping this socialist takeover .
you and all the other 2nd amendment grabbers will not survive the next election
tom , no doubt .
thee utmost respect for you mia !
vote &quot; no &quot; mr. mcclintock !
what about all the people who now have insurance who cannot afford it otherwise .
balanced budget
if he had , congress would be trying to start impeachment proceedings .
do what you will because the american people have no say it seems .
lifting him to the heavenly father .
why didn &apos;t you rinos do something your fired
my thoughts are : mia 2016 !
amen thank-you lordi prayed that he would win
ryan uses that $ 716 billion reduction in his own medicare reduction plan .
he &apos;s a little late and as usual has no remedies .
but you gave up your constitutional right to veto this deal
keeping you all in our prayers .
send troops to border !
i certainly hope the house rejects the reid attachment .
i will support you sir .
presidential vacations come to mind .
guess we will be removing all flags from national memorials next .
i am certain that mchenry knows the situation is not simple .
this guy lies everytime he speaks .
guaranteed veto .
just get mau - marines and go in and get him .
don &apos;t even think oh giving in to those idiots hold the line george
senator when will the impeachment process start ?
praying for you ! !
follow the constitution !
kerry , obummer , biden , pelosi , reid , holder are crooks .
our country is being attacked from within .
i &apos;d rather have that than a state income tax
when will he and his staff quit referring to isis as isil ?
president paul
either do something or resign , senator rand paul senator ted cruz
praying for you trey
obama care gone job back to usa
sautayed rice .

tim whats next for the state , does it stop here ?
defund the healthcare reform act !
bruce poliquin you have my vote
may god bless you in the coming year .
just look at and compare kansas and california
yea for scott brown ... whoohoo !
obama is not a president .
john mccain has turned his back on america and her greatness .
may god be with you always !
so , romney didn &apos;t win because those pesky christians are anti-mormon ?
then- no special insurance , retirement or vacations .
no more beheadings in oklahoma !
oklahoma ranks among the highest in national board certified teachers .
keep pushing forward mr lankford !
please reconsider your support of this nomination .
congress alone has authority to declare war , yet they refuse .
you are just sucking up to the devos name !
okay.sorry i believed it for even a second , bruce .
you no longer represent any republican or conservative in any way .
stand up mia .
its called patriot !
# randonmsnbc # standwithrand
the sequester has cut funding to hls .
no replacement until a new president .
cruz isn &apos;t eligible .
so glad to have a conservative sitting where mary sat .
from the do nothing congress that has a 12 % approval rating .
rubio was born 4 years before his parents became citizens ! ! !
watch out jeff flake .
stfu you rino
she is totally unqualified for the position of secretary of education .
john boehner has lost my confidence .
impeach the traitor ! !
anything short of a full defunding of obamacare is stopping too short .
in your face mr. paul .
god bless you as well , mr .
mc cain is not one of the good guys .
why are we still sending weapons south of the border ?
absolutely love it ! ! ! !
if you vote for the cr , you &apos;ve voted for obamacare .
we expect that those who cut the line will not be unfairly rewarded .
isn &apos;t this alone enough to impeach obama ?
so tell me if its between rubio and clinton who will you vote for ?
keep up the good work trey gowdy !
trey gowdy i concur with you 100 %
congressman lamborn , i had called your office in regards to this issue .
patrick feild , the federal government does not force you to buy auto insurance .
with all due respect ms. blackburn , this president is a liberal special interest .
tom mcclintock ( r-ca ) you just another radical pig ! ! ! ! !
gostei da posi√ß√£o dela , tem mais testosterona do que o sr. obama
it &apos;s up to you guys , impeach the pos .
we should just do a national sales tax , exempt unprepared food and medicine .
say no to the establishment and yes to america !
we expected so much more from you paul .
how about sending the refugees to gitmo for screening .
again sir ... that &apos;s part of why we sent you ! ! !
lindsey said the following &quot; i would prefer ( gov .
but small potatoes compared to his treason !
the left in washington d.c. is wrong and time will also prove this too ...
love to you , dr. paul and your family .
my bet is lynn you are not qualified to make such a judgement .
our president is a complete waste and has set america back 100 years .
that is what you and all other republicans were elected for .
what dave hunt said what about the irs purchase ?
kentucky here .
mia start your own party .
what about her emails ? ? ? ?
why haven &apos;t you and the rest in dc not listen until now .
, you dare question the genius of cesar obama !
too bad we can &apos;t lay off this administration !
fix the tax code and get rid of excessive regulation
trey gowdy for vp !
the new congress is not our ticket of this mess .
karma , senator flake , karma .
most of the people in washington need to go ... but not all .
i want you to all my family vote for sir
rand , when are you going to endorse graham ?
ben i do not like your opinion .
makes me believe the republicans want obamacare as much as obama does .
get the government out of the health care and insurance business !
i thought the government did everything for us ! ! !
senator enzi , respectfully , you &apos;re vote makes no sense .
apparently mr paul has a separate situation with mr king .
mia would you push to get rid of income tax and irs .
some people need to pick up a constitution and read it .
i think lindsey is doing what all the legislatures need to do .
repeal obamacare and immigration .
get rid of all the illegal criminals.one way ticket home .
can we now impeach this idiot ?
you betrayed the state of south carolina .
then go defund some other wasteful spending !
you have been a rhino for far too long .
tax !
obama has no clue what hes doing hes doing worse that bush was now
--thanks ray for doing absolutely nothing .
i am sick of the government doing anything at this point .
lindsey , no one wants you go away !
cut everything arbitrarily and increase military spending arbitrarily .
the future of this country may very well be in your hands sir .
don &apos;t raise the ceiling debt !
i think most of the setting republicans now are rinos .
i like your spending plan mr barton .
true defender of liberty .
i am with you mia love !
the obama government should stop foreign aid to every country .
he is a socialist and a muslim sympathizer .
but you are right about the republican party .
no wonder we can &apos;t get anything done .
the enemy of my enemy is my friend .
send them back and secure the border !
no lover of liberty wants a government that is .
republicans were elected to stop obama &apos;s one man rule .
no question , he should not be afforded the rights of an american citizen .
they will have enemies if there is no understanding .
why are dems not getting many likes on rand pauls page ?
goo get them evil fools rand paul 2016
because o is king .
do well for maine bruce .
obama needs more substance .
he has gone against our constitution more than he &apos;s been for it !
mr gowdy please expose comet &amp; besta pizza .
damn , i love my us flag bought at walmart and made in china .
obamacare has force our family to pay more for less coverage .
he has long term plans with this or he wouldn &apos;t do it .
tell em rand ! ! !
god bless the rand paul campaign - and god bless america !
stand by the laws you created , nobody can not be exempt from obamacare .
praying for all our fellow georgians who are suffering such heart break !
mr. traister , check the u.s. constitution .
that deal = major major problems in the future .. no deal
firing someone for upholding the constitution is irresponsible .
marco rubio for 2016 !
it is a tax that was not passed as a tax
does congress have the authority to tax americans at different rates ?
he has guts and a back bone along with being an american patriot .
may our lord guide your path and bless you with his wisdom .
in all circumstance , this whole shebang falls flat on it &apos;s face !
senator portman - please vote no on betsy devos .
obama is the one who is leading us to financial disaster .
how is passing obamacare last year working out for the american people ?
now it is obvious you have none .
why not thune for president ?
i &apos;m so sick of the republican party not standing behind mr. trump .
10. balance the budget .
i &apos;m embarrassed by ted cruz , his vm was full when i called ...
either of az two senators have notcommitted to voting no on the cloture bill !
i hope you will vote yes on impeachment soon .
senator graham what is being done about the military budget cuts ?
not much support for you here , sam .
voting for this bill is an abandonment of conservative values
time to go rino
now mr. boehner wants to halt the f &amp; f ?
what we do about the buffett tax really does
i think you should hang it up
how are going to vote on amnesty sir ?
rand paul , you are another pitici
i thought you were different , ben .
i can only pray that will happen soon , very soon .
you , sir , are just the man to begin what must be done .
what is the update on our troops in ebola countries ?
hopefully cuba won &apos;t repeat iraq &apos;s mistake !
amen amen amen , mia ! !
if you were against obama care we wouldn &apos;t have obama care .
i say yes if these are true sales not foreign aid .
thanks for standing with us dave .
this current president and his administration does not .
i think we need a new speaker of the house .
the fairtax is far superior to any flat tax ! !
look at the patriot act , nsa spying , lawless leadership .
defend the constitution
i am sick of hearing about our broken immigration policies .
trey gowdy should have been speaker !
betsy devos is a joke !
fox has just projected rand paul the winner !
yes i did he has got my vote
i cannot thank bruce and his staff enough .
mccain and gramm are old and out of touch .
pass a budget and stick to it and stop whining about spending and debt .
you should have supported your republican candidate as soon as he won the nomination .
we don &apos;t want another tax , we are already taxed to death .
repeal gatt !
but the guy is helping rand win so - shut it !
the federal government is only proficient at blowing stuff up and taxation .
guess tsa doesn &apos;t exactly mean to save america ! !
the progressive socialist in dc are following saul alinsky doctrine .
he has always been consistently conservative .
bruce got the highest possible rating he was eligible to receive .
flat tax or no tax better .
trey would stand strong !
you are shutting down the govt you get the blame nobody else .
something profound from john mccain .
obama is delusional ! !
how abt defunding obamacare now !
my little american boy is serving in the military .
i for one don &apos;t give a quack what you think !
goehmert for speaker !
pass a balanced budget .
ted cruz was run against by the establishment rino in his state .
obama had a lot more to do with obamacare ( without gop support ! )
senator rubio is completely right - their values are our values .
i have unfriended boehner and rubio .
same to u sir !
the freedoms we have are guided by the bible .
remember you were elected to honor and support the constitution first .
when has the law ever stopped him from doing things he shouldnt
charleston is such a wonderful place .
that would be a gulag lindsey graham ! !
great comment tom .
will be there sen. thune , saw you last night on hannity .
mr scott you owe the people of south carolina an apology .
indeed , the administration is out of control .
our liberty &amp; money being stolen at same time .
^ shhhhh , bob - logical questions are not allowed .
great to meet you last night at little mike hamburgers we are praying for you
robert , he is putting america first .
sir , the intent is good however they are already here .
good job sir god bless you
i really wish the rest of the republican leadership would have done the same .
you have now solidly proven that you are no &quot; conservative &quot; .
impeach now the ......
not to sure james , but we need to play better
if rinos are jamming you up call them out .
it &apos;s about debt !
if it &apos;s against the law , then don &apos;t let him do it .
explain to us how the fair tax is fair to the middle class ?
do not cave in to the socialist demands of obama and its senate .
if not for him , for the good of the republican party .
get it together lindsey !
rand for pres .
please listen to your constituents and reconsider .
comey has no spine for what is needed to be done .
tim , who &apos;s paying you ?
you and mccain are an embarrassment and should both retire .
everyone in that shut down building needs to be charged with treason !
an embarrassment for tennessee
go , rand paul .
our freedom , our rights , our constitution is being battered on all sides .
i stand with the go veneers and not the federal government
we are all standing with you mia !
defund it sir
a minimalist constitutional government is what we should be aiming for .
can we impeach obama on grounds of treason ?
a network out to make money , duh !
she is far better at explaining conservative solutions than most republicans .
rand , go away !
no we don &apos;t like his tax and spend plan .
merry christmas congressman gowdy !
happy thanksgiving sir , god bless
wake up people and lets stop giving or selling our own country .
so , you don &apos;t think the government should pay its bills ?
people who listen to their voters and not the republican party .
thanks for supporting rand paul &apos;s amendment .
minnesota conservatives are with you , mia .
praying for wisdom , peace god &apos;s blessing on you all
start the impeachment now please
he probably has more praying for him than any candidate ever in history .
bring our boys home and keep the jihadists out .
president obama has bluster , then pull back .
trey gowdy stand your ground &amp; stay in the fight .
and scott desjarlais keep up the good fight !
that &apos;s what the constitution protects you from you feeble minded people .
we are going to have to cut spending drastically in the near future .
tom mcclintock some of the posts on your wall are discracefull and unamerican .
stand with our troops !
it &apos;s time for some cuban power in the white house !
screw the republican party .
cut spending drastically .
i might support a clean cr if harry reid resigned immediately .
rooney also seems to have no confidence in our constitutional justice system .
you sir , have gone against the will of the people .
john kerry needs to go home and take obama with him .
impeach the prick while your at it !
vote no , sir .
god bless you sir , and god save the republic .
hope the people of kentucky can see that .
i &apos;m amazed only 77 % oppose .
mr strange do u have ur own page ?
everyone died for the american flag .
we just keep giving money and supplies to egypt and they hate us .
happy easter james !
but probably wouldn &apos;t scream foul if a flat tax was implemented .
this will be your last term you traitor !
even speaker boehner admits this .
maybe the fbi are afraid of losing their jobs !
i understand that mrs. devos has given large campaign contributions to many republican congresspeople .
sweet stay the course !
i love israel !
little late in the day mr. ryan !
mr. paul , we stand with you !
it &apos;s time to kick this loser out of office .
johnny isakson , respectfully , reconsider .
he wasn &apos;t supposed to turn in his spine with his ta 50 equipment .
you and ted cruz are good team for 2016. i &apos;ll vote for you .
simplify tax codes and create tax tiers based on revenue .
sense when does he obey the law !
just excuses to allow illegals in !
ben was always at war with his vices .
you represent the people of georgia not just the republicans of georgia .
your decision to support devos tells me you have not , sir .
i just hope harper has the guts to vote no also .
please push for a repeal .
you stand for liberty and a better american future .
love it mia love !
love you congresswoman mia love ...... keep up the good work !
and you supported mitch for speaker !
you should have told the potus you had a higher priority with the filibuster .
another nc teacher here , asking you to vote no .
as long as the cadillac tax is gone ! !
vp candidate ryan votes no to save on war , yes to cut medicare .
marsha marsha marsha .... you better be nice , girl lol ...
as always , proud of our senator rand paul .
he crams his authority down peoples throat like the obama care for instances .
he should be running on a socialist ticket .
bless you sir , hon mr. gowdy .
merry christmas mia have wonderful day ...................
you are a patriot , sir .
please do not support obama in this path .
now will the senate and wh follow ?
he should have done something about it a long time ago .
i &apos;d vote for mia anytime ! !
you cant trust any answers you receive from obama .
i have to agree with mccain .
she does not listen to the american people !
yay rand i agree completely .
thanks tom you and your colleagues are definitely thinking about your next election .
clearly obama is not a supreme being or of supreme intellect .
the republicans did not do this to obama .
rand paul for president , repeal 1913 .
he might support obama but that is because of obama &apos;s foreign policy .
we see that you voted for the omnibus spending bill .
does anything he does surprise you ?
by your support of it you have branded yourself a fool and a traitor .
betsy devos is unqualified for secretary of education period !
james lankford you are mr prioritizer !
no repeal it !
most like living on all the welfare and entitlement programs .
praying for to happen ! !
marsha did this because mitch mcconnell told her to .
past time to impeach obama
and yes , may god bless america !
pointing out his so-called failed administration is meaningless .
trey please lock up that pos clinton thing ....
example this is the 1st veto .
very well said , please send that message to him mia in your own words
you cannot donate to obama here but are given your first amendment right .
good luck , mr. scott .
keeping you in my prayers sir
this thing was not even read and forced through with no republican votes !
it is not a christian tree .
this president has done nothing for the country , only against us .
the irs should go after the tea baggers .
house republicans will vote to repeal the affordable care act again on tuesday .
you &apos;re wrong on this one tom
1.2 million unborn children were killed due to abortion in 2008
speak truth mia !
but your man lindsay was never there to bail you out .
we need more young conservative blood like cruz and lee
so are expecting an enemy to invade us ?
you will not get my vote come reelection .
hugs and prayers to amanda and her family !
i don &apos;t see any scenario where a conservative gets freedom of speech honestly .
i voted for you as a conservative .
we pray for you often .
rand , we finally have a strong leader for the republican party !
no body wants to be called politically incorrect so they go along .
impeach him now b-4 it &apos;s to late 3 : )
mia for vp !
fair tax is what we need abolish the irs .
may god keep you in his hands ! ! !
those constitution patriot people are so dangerous !
obama needs to go üêµ üêµ üêµ üêµ üêµ
i have no confidence that the obama administration will do anything to a democrat .
no m√°s ! !
we can secure the borders without it .
congress is in charge of spending .
i wish lynn would do the same .
you voted for cloture , fucknuckles .
stop him he is the biggest looser
karen is absolutely correct !
sanford already had a chance at congress and governor .
america : impeach the dude ! ! !
so congressman coffman , do something .
tim is right .
hear , hear , mr. mcclintock !
that was a dumb move there johnny &quot; maverick : .
i watched rand paul &apos;s speech on this topic .
well said mr. zeldin .
no wonder you are running for reelection .
praying the only way to start .
talked to your staff in washington and in kansas .
a no ball president !
marco was a part of the forum and also spoke ( eloquently ) .
the cloture vote is the only on that counts !
no budget increase .
he hasn &apos;t done anything else he has talked about ....
please reconsider and listen to all of your constituents .
we would really appreciate a town hall setting though .
you should run mia !
i &apos;m sure their 10 viewers will appreciate it .
happy easter to you and yours sir .
the speaker is a mouse and needs to vacate asap !
why not just a flat tax with no deductions ? ? ? ?
he took an oath of office to uphold the constitution .
i hate you john mccain
if anything , that alone says a great deal about the state of utah .
enough talking and no action .
devos has funneled taxpayer money away from public schools to substandard private schools .
and sold out to rubio and the establishment ? ? ?
devos is not for public education .
ted cruz all the way ! !
obama would have little chance to repeal the patriot act .
corporate welfare unchecked - we have a collection problem - not a spending problem .
oh yeah lindsey .
hang in there sir !
@ robert yea and rand endorses mitt which is just like obama .
and crimea wanted to go back to russia , but ukraine wouldnt let them .
you mean govt grows too big , out of control , welfare state ?
these wars have destroyed our military , you idiot .
trying to shred the constitution .
this demonstrates that you are neither .
it &apos;s amazing how much the establishment of both parties hate liberty
until then , you are no better than our lawless president .
then if biden insists on the liberal agenda , we impeach him too ! !
flat tax please
after the rubio endorsement it &apos;s hard to take you seriously .
praying for you in michigan ,
i &apos;m concerned mr. mc clintock !
happy anniversary mr. lankford !

resignation of comey or investigation on him for treason and dereliction of duty
we have a beautiful flag for our country that includes everyone here .
we need more patriots like rand paul to step up .
merry christmas to you and your family senator tim scott .
i don &apos;t believe any of ya &apos;ll are going to do anything .
you all probably watch fox news ,
communist government .
they could not stand the man !
i would however support it if our government was more fiscally accountable and responsible .
border security is of course extremely important .

apparently , it didn &apos;t sweep obamacare .
i agree that obamacare is about control .
prayers for all affected .

you must be talking about obama
god bless and keep you safe and stay strong ! ! !
same here go rand paul
will they ever cut spending ?
we can &apos;t impeach until we have the senate in nov ! !
jennifer it is not true that congress is exempted from obamacare .
we should not spend dollar 1 unless our national security is at stake .
people who can &apos;t pay for insurance cant pay for obama care .
you sir are what is wrong with the republican party today .
i stand with wacko bird ! !
rand , my mom likes you and she lives in edmonton .
ronald reagan would never have backed this ! ! !
who invoked the no carry policy for the military ?
it &apos;s a good thing he vetoed it .
just send a clean bill and stop the games .
fox is great and the only news channel to watch .
defund them all , especially when it comes to the illegal immigrants .
now it &apos;s time to repeal obama !
mr. rubio has been criticized for giving preferential treatment to the dosal tobacco company .
god bless you ! !
defund planned parenthood ( they failed ) 6 . )
stephanie , the pres has no constitutional obligation to submit a budget .
i am very upset with your house of representatives that treated the obama admin .

paradise vern !
anyone who stands up to obummer is okay in my book .
did someone fail to inform them that oklahoma is a red state ?
please stick to the fair and balanced media arena .
wow , great timely endorsement paul ... exactly when did you wake up ?
your vote is bought &amp; paid for by devos .
you sir are no better than the last has been you replaced .
our georgia reps are spineless robots !
i agree with trey gowdy
you have not held the line on spending .
look at eight years under reagan and another under bush .
tom , we truly appreciate your clarity of insight and honest communication .
we want our liberty back .
thank u james , praying for all the work u do .
with that , amnesty for illegals + obamacare = attack on american workers !
our constitutional democracy , the american liberty and freedoms is first and foremost .
shame obama shame
mr. jason chaffetz you went to that clown college byu .
why is obama not arrested for high treason , giving arms to terrorists ?
stop siding with harry reid and vote no on cloture !
stopped to pray for you as i posted !
happy thanksgiving to you trey gowdy enjoy your day with your family !
viva rubio !
he should have been removed long ago .
real conservatives should vote for gary johnson .
and demand they send the ones they got back ...
tom help get rid of all evil on the u s
quit giving money to our enemy &apos;s .
&quot; make no mistake--we need conservative leadership in the white house . &quot;

i just don &apos;t understand your support of mrs. devos .
lincoln county tn
obama is backwards on anything thats common sense for the good of america !
you got my vote rand !
harry reid &apos;s plan , would preserve america &apos;s aaa credit rating .
it was especially good to hear mr. obama acknowledge the exceptionalism of america .
obama do whatever he wanted .
this would give them an excuse to arrest or declare martial law !
supporting candidates like rand is more important than ever .
he should have been impeached long ago and charged with several counts of treason .
government needs to live within their budget also .
obama has had five years to secure the border .
rep. king - i read you want government out of your health care .
maybe they should be called traitors and not senators .
we conservatives didn &apos;t give you the majority once again for you to squander .
well good i.m glad but he will veto it if it comes to his desk
i will vote for mia love as the 2016 president .
hang in there johnny , i believe they may well descend yet
stand up to obama.repeal obamacare .

yess reagan had a dream too .
you a traitor to the constitution and a traitor to the people .
no to obamacare , no to amnesty for illegals .
it is so obvious what he is up to .
the wh occupant is doing everything to put our military in further jeopardy ! !
until this country turns back to the lord jesus christ , we are doomed !
i don &apos;t trust bo

mccain can stay , but all the rest need to retire .

john , it &apos;s too bad you &apos;re just another rino .
maybe you should read the constitution again !
we have a broken political system not a broken immigration system .
yet another effort by your party to defund planned parenthood .
amen , marco rubio
he is detained just because he is his father &apos;s son .
obama &apos;s poor decision making is spreading like wildfire ... ps - defund aca
please fight obama &apos;s unilateral amnesty .
no money for them and don &apos;t give a penny to obamacare !
no arms for our enemies
really rand what do u stand for
it &apos;s that pesky constitution thing strikes again .
he does not represent the true values of sc conservatives .
no , it was the military industrial complex that lied to bush .
the government spending is out of control .
so disappointed in all the rinos compromising by sending this bill forward .
quite evident senator mccain didn &apos;t even read the bill .
thanks scott
he has gotten away with too much lawlessness while congress does nothing !
yes you rand paul are nothing but a homeland terrorist !
i still support marco rubio .
repeal but must replace with an alternative or it will go nowhere !
it is now time princess lindsey to sprinkle your fairy dust and disappear .
our potus needs to step down now !
we should have never caved .
shut up about ted cruz we like him .
nobody can just ignore the constitution .
trey gowdy , what should be our next move as citizens ?
defund nsa and half of military spending before you defund obamacare .
we obviously have no qualifications for the job except republican and rich .
good luck mitch
shutting down the government should not be a priority .
assad is not a dictator not a terrorist .
seneca sc .
paul ryan should have said this months ago !
the spitefulness of this president and harry reid is unprecedented .
lil &apos; marco please stop drinking and tweeting --lol
if only congress had the guts to stop him !
you will be a slave to the government debt machine $ $ $ $
houston should not drag on this issue much longer .
you need to be charged with treason .
stay wacko rand ... : )
now your going after movies ... hey johnny , you &apos;ve lost your mind !
lindsey , thanks for looking out for sc and bruce amen to your comment .
obama is truly the enemy within in mine &amp; many others opinion .
prayers are with you &amp; yours from georgia
- senator mitch mcconnell , senate gop leader .
rand paul for 2016 ! ! ! ! !
neither party stands on principles that this country was formed on .
rinos need to disappear !
lindsey graham is wrong .
no leader of ours should act like a dictator .
amnesty is worst , not obama care .
mr. president , why did we go to war in libya ?
you should be ashamed of yourself lynn .
nicely said , dr. paul !
do your job , senator ... read our constitution !
well congress { gop } fled washington again without doing anything .
it just proves he is a traitor !
the congressman on the hill
don &apos;t dish it out if you can &apos;t handle it !
because our president is an idiot
another stupid obama policy
tell them to read the immigration law that is in the book .
forget vetting , don &apos;t let them in period !
god bless you-from one cuban to another .
we need aggressive conservative leadership not more establishment leaders !
go get him mia love
flat tax please !
close them now
he gets everything he wants handed to him .
i had hopes of a change of heart from you mr. graham
no , no , no , she is not qualified for this position .
all due respect , but no sale , sir .
this arrogant man could be dangerous if he does not get his own way .
we just need to repeal the government .
i &apos;ve been praying over this .
i pray god will move on the president to not veto .
unfortunately , too little too late !
not a conservative either .
well if we go bankrupt obama will probably blame the republican &apos;s
agree with you , trey gowdy .
yep utah is the best !
the first step is impeachment !
i didn &apos;t say marsha was political .
trey gowdy needs to have a wallet that says bad mofo on it .
how much does paul ryan &apos;s budget plan cut in fy 2012 ?
that was all commenced under the bush administration and led by the bush dept .
no refugees in south carolina ! !
we say no , hell no
praying you succeed , capt higgins !
bill , better a libertarian than a liberal .
sorry our pres doesn &apos;t lead us now - except to the poor house
nooooooooo authority ! !
@ thom dean how about you fix your flag .
semper fi my friend ...
the truth is obvious ... actlion us next douglas e graham
economy , immigration ( not border security !
i got money to bet that carnahan would vote against such an amendment !
don &apos;t lose heart james .
and also , how about a town hall meeting ?
we will loose more than what is listed if obamacare stays in affect .
thats why im voting for trump or cruz
we don &apos;t have an immigration national security crisis ; stop blaming immigrants !
i will pray for you !
you and lindsey can bite off
you rock mr. paul !
so john will you stand up agains oboma this time or just set back again
cause any where the us wont give foreign help , someone else will .
paul for the constitution 2016
tell the epa to stand down or else .
repeal obummercare .
hang tough luke .... fight the obama curse ! ! ! !
you sir are a traitor .
but our president doesn &apos;t want to either .

lindsey , i am in 100 % agreement with you .
the flat tax is the right tax .
fiorina , dr carson , rubio and walker .
i love jesus christ .
i &apos;ll stand for rand from the seat of the revolution .
and how incompetent obummer is !
praying for you and the entire family .
oppose , where do i begin , just vote no
we are not a socialist country ......... yet !
you do realize you &apos;re not a republican anymore .
this isn &apos;t liberty .
ryan / rubio 2016 with speaker of the house trey gowdy .
obama supported facist president morsi and we toppled morsi down by peacefull demonstrations .
god bless .. more prayers coming
may god bless you and your efforts .
something great to god is in store .
led by obama and reid that refused negotiations .
no more raising the debt ceiling , let &apos;s instead lower the entitlement population !
you should have brought the party together months ago .
i will never support christie for anything !
not exactly a spending cut is it ?
marco get ready 2016 you may be our own hope !
pass a balanced budget law .
obama writes his &quot; own constitution &quot; and shoves it down our american throats .
obama care is wrong , unconstitutional , and a lie .
johnny , please oppose ! ! !
fair tax and eliminate obamacare
senate will vote down and president will use veto
if there is no debt ceiling increase , obama cannot spend .
south carolina was a landslide victory for trump .
prayers for the scott family
he is a godly man who stands up for our freedom and liberty ! !
he has got to stop spending money we just do not have !
small government and personal liberty .
the people of florida voted 4 donald trump .
go rand go .. president 2016

they are in god &apos;s army now
proud of our guy in sc .
it &apos;s unconstitutional and citizens are fed up !
go trey go .
thanks and god bless !
really sir , it is not very becoming or professional .
i still can &apos;t get over rand endorsing a stoog like romney .
just remember when voting for the speaker , boehner has to go !
mccain needs to retire ....
don &apos;t let the wh bully you and the supporters or our constitution !
god bless you trey gowdy , you &apos;re one in a million .
praise god that is awesome
i finally agree with a paul ryan statement
want em gone , vote em out !
libertarians advocate freedom and uphold the fundamentals of our constitution .
i &apos;m not stupid enough to see where returning gitmo is a good idea .
send kerry and obama in first .
richard yaun graham is another piece of garbage !
you should have been here months ago !
barry wants a total meltdown .
the constitution !
hurry and finish north and south freeway .
this is not what our founding father &apos;s had in mind !
god bless you johnny isakson .
amen bob
john mccain , america &apos;s president , in my heart !
the az law is a violation of the constitution .
i expect you to vote against john boehner being the house majority leader tim .
reforming the tax code is a tougher one but go for it !
senator thune , hope they win for you .
to think the irs will have a key role with obamacare makes me nauseous !
and they call him a traitor !
i remember castro coming to power .
way to go tim scott ! ! !
iranian &quot; deal &quot; is treason ! !
but what is johnny boy going to do to make sure he does that ?
then the constitution must be changed .
repeal obamacare an no amnesty for illegals .
mccain needs to retire and pass on to the next hell .
we will continue praying for you
this is oklahoma we have first hand information on how inept he is .
what about the states that have no sales tax ?
sending &lt; 3 and prayers to senator tim scott and his family ....
there is no compromise on this !
john mccain is an establishment sell out .. retire now
killing ranchers for standing up forthe constitution !
you and mccain officially jumped the shark today .
brown : is this the scandal that will bring obama down ?
so if you replace it will also fail .
congressman bruce poliquin for maine .... let pelosi screw up somebody else &apos;s business !
shut this dictator down ! !
beat the establishment
i hope it won &apos;t be too late .
remove your head from your a $ $ and stand up for the constitution !
rand paus is a disgrace .
the epa is killing businesses in this country !
we can pray for our nation .
his resignation , or maybe he will come out of the closet
impeach obama and others who are not upholding the laws of our constitution .
ms. devos is simply not qualified for this position .
good luck james hope u win
he just wants to hurt america and its ppl .
i likesenpail but i disagree with him on cuba

would like to see a town hall preannounced .
i &apos;m praying that they root out the corruption , fraud , and waste .
another terrorist attack on american soil .
in 2 weeks time we have lost our standing in the world !
wasn &apos;t this exemplified in the debt ceiling aftermath .
like it or not this falls on the republican party , not the president .
requesting you to not repeal the aca , but fix or restructure .
do like he did stand up for america &amp; the constitution !
.. you say you are conservative .
let him veto and be a fool all he likes .
if he does , congress must impeach him out .
do all that you can tom cotton !
take paul ryan with you .

your resignation marsha , nothing more , nothing less .
wow a red flag the first time .
we also need a congress to stand up to him !
well quit playing the war of words and impeach him
let your people of south carolina eat cake ..... karma ! ! !
another one thrown under the obama bus .

your constituency demands you vote no on devos !
thanks for the heads up , trey gowdy .
stop obama s socialist agenda .
mia you hit it on the head .
douglas , no internet search was necessary .
that is what we sent you in for .
rand paul , and the rest at cpac deserve a standing ovation !
congress needs to do their job and protect america .
obama doesn &apos;t care
the president has no spending power .
the conservatives been sold out by liberals for a long time .
keep &apos; em honest mia
( president ronald reagan )
its goal is the collapse of free market capitalism .
that is not allowed by the constitution , but that never stopped him .
hey marsha , what are you doing in washington ?
bush had one called the patriot act .
well said from the man who should have been the republican candidate .
john mccain will never know what it &apos;s like to be president .
oh and ditch your bodyguards since your equall to all of us you traitor .
no rodney .
your responsibility is to your constituents , not the party nor the speaker .
federal laws we need : 1. a law that requires a balanced budget .
may god continues to bless you and your family .
lines keep growing , obama could be pres .
blake hayes
put him in jail ! !
wish i knew who was running in n c that lined up with ron paul
you signed a pledge sir ! !
unfortunately for america , obama will tell you it &apos;s free .
i stand with ted cruz !
ryan wood
obama &apos;s epa gave environmental groups the names and addresses of farmers .
bye bye ryan !
i want the $ 1500 in my pocket from cutting my payroll tax .
ted cruz is our only hope ! ! !
oh btw &quot; repeal &quot; that disaster obamacare , do not replace it !
the ndaa is a treasonous stab in the back of the american people .
cannot believe we are flying them around the country and yet not back home .
let him have it !
thanks , james !
irony , no !
he can &apos;t veto jack crap if he &apos;s impeached
just asking , since the government will not admit where it is .
if the president is doing wrong then why doesn &apos;t the senate stop him ?
but the o is neither king nor pharoah ... he is a dictator .
shame on you , marsha blackburn .
the military needs to be here in our country fighting for our freedom .
we &apos;re ready to follow and back a courageous , strong , conservative leader !
i do not expect that our constitutional liberties to be restored .
serve &quot; we the people &quot; .
i believe with guys like huckabee , christie and bush .
good luck with the rinos this year ted .
borders budget military
get the government out of it !
mcclintock is scheduled to work 113 days next year for a $ 174,000.00 .
you are the &quot; wacko bird &quot; and an embarrassment .
we have to much land all ready lock up from the government .
impeachment long overdue ....
i wish you the best mia , go show em how to do it .
he has shifted power away from our checks and balances .
you guys need to find some way to stop this tyrant .
say no to obamacare
reward for her part in benghazi
bring our troops home and secure our borders !
christie does not have a prayer in the next presidential campaign .
good lord we are doomed as a nation .
i am so disappointed in you , rep. blackburn .
obama has far less executive orders than w bush .
mccain has a way with words !
he was selected by mitch for a reason .
obama has purposly placed susan rice in the position to push he weight around .
i pray that you continue to lead an ever-increasing strength .
marsha how about you start caring about the environment instead of your corporate sugar daddies
god bless her and the rubio family .. lord keep them safe always !
true conservative
there is no work ! !
vote for obama to go to jail asap ! ! !
he is betraying our allies , and our own best interests .
how about getting rid of govt healthcare ! !
does that mean that you are giving up on getting obamacare changed ?
your a good man rand , say hi to pops !
john mccain does not represent the people any longer .
the federal government has disability hiring programs but they are a joke .
good speech marco rubio !
he is turning into a real piece of crap !
i was curious why israel would support our taking action .
i hear lots of complaints about obamacare but no solutions to access and affordability .
what a stupid tool you are graham !
always glad to see you on fox john !
happy thanksgiving trey to you &amp; yours .
another republican rino at work .
you guys just have to take back washington !
expect most if south la .
why doesn &apos;t congressman ted yoho know how our government runs ?
this is why the conservatives and republicans are failing .
our constitution is for americans only .
the fact that you would even consider voting for obama shows you are clueless !
about 3 dozen permanent jobs would be created .
no fair tax .
the man in the white house is deliberately hurting america .
nope didn &apos;t want to watch .
obama has deported millions more illegals than any prior president .
obama is not working !
traitor ! ! ! !
prayers ... may god bless you all &amp; return you home safe .
we need results , rand .
we need scotus to believe and defend the constitution .
there is no representation for any conservatives in the republican party .
so they keep delaying till 2014 , and next till 2016
cut taxes further without cutting spending that actually matters .
maybe it was teleprompters that helped them get their position like it helped obama .
lindsey , keep funding our warfighters ! !
thank the lord - praying !
bob is an honorable guy .
the tea party will split and a third party will grow .
betsy devoss gave you $ 23,000 and that is what you are listening to .
keep your conservative values !
paul would rape obama .
how about voting to determine that the current potus is ineligible .
way to represent the american people , marsha !
go johnny isakson
repeal the whole law that &apos;s what i &apos;m praying for .
how did congress stop military action in the libyan &quot; no fly zone &quot; ?
hey won &apos;t that upset the illegals
in case you has not heard , gop leadership has agreed as well .
he is very wrong ! !
pass the cr but don &apos;t give out false info for scare tactics .
but , no !
please stand with sen. cruz and stop obamacare now !
thank &apos;s again ted !
i have the solution to the entire problem ...
how about doing us a big favor and convene impeachment proceedings against him ?
cut off all aid to countries who have anti-american ideals .
you wont get any answers with pres o in office ... you already kniw that
so why is government shutting down such a bad thing ? !
well said greg .
wonder how long before vern deletes my post ..
lindsey .
rand paul , and i expect your endorsement !
now the fbi has lost credibility in the eyes of the people .
that is the cold hard facts , mr gowdy !
you are so right on mia ! !
also voted for boehner and another trillion dollar bill that the president desperately wanted .
but you know the epa knows best .
11 million plus illegals is not an immigration problem it is an invasion !
plus he thinks he &apos;s king and he can do anything he wants .
impeach his @ $ $ !
you dear sir have just lost many many votes !
those against the aca say the american people are behind them .
tying the funding for dhs into the defunding of the executive orders is ridiculous .
just glad that someone in washington is doing their job .
when is your in-person town hall going to be ?
will be praying for them .
rand paul , please know that you don &apos;t just have kentucky behind you .
they lie about welfare calling him the welfare king lie .
the federal government is set on passing legislation to restrict all our freedoms .
shut off his free multimillion dollar vacations and michell will do the rest .
the goverment needs to get up and do something and quit talking about it .
marco , i hope you are president someday .
mccain : you stink you rotten traitor .
only stupid and lazy people are still supporting obama !
from an educator , and voter in georgia please vote no !
it was long overdue &quot; bruce lindner .
before tampering with the constitution try applying it &apos;s principles !
i so wanted the chance to vote for you ... god bless you sir .
keep an eye on mia , and nikki haley ( sc ) .
he should have gone to the congressional oversight committee instead of to the media .
it gets worse every year , our government is becoming our own worse enemy .
what would you impeach him of ?
with you on this 100 % tom .
good one dave .
we are behind you lindsey
stop placating the anti-gunners and stand firm .
how much influence does the central banks have on you mr. trey gowdy ?
we no not want an international commission setting immigration policy for the u.s.
peter king needs some lessons in protocol .
devos is not the answer !
also support mark meadows in his effort to remove john boehner .
no , ted .
is it not congress &apos; constitutional responsibility to declare war ?
anything else with obamacare is trying to resuscitate a dead horse .
congress controls the purse strings , not the administration .
i would like to see congress have some back bone .
the epa should be demolished .
thanks paul keep the heat on .
rubio is a man of integrity .
ditch welfare to all of the foreign gimme gimmes , including israel !
obama is presidential , dignified , qualified .
obozo wants to be a dictator !
&quot; no law respecting an establishment of religion . &quot;
could you guys impeach this traitor already ?
no taxes , period !
the debt ceiling will be raised .
why is congress getting subsidies for their luxury private government paid health ins ?
rand , you put tears to my eyes the other day .
so support your republican nominee .
marco rubio vp .
besides ted nugent ?
we won &apos;t rein in anything until mitt romney is elected president !
my tax rate was negative 8 % !
no thanks to you , mia .
lindsey let us know where to donate.and all our prayers to those folks .
you are traitor
see tim scott &apos;s response anthony .
the republican debates were all about pitting the debaters against each other .
@ charles you speak of the libertarian party .
and all you seem to care about is obamacare repeal and bengazi .
maybe we can legally smoke cuban cohiba cigars soon .
we appreciate you so much trey gowdy .
save the speech &apos;s til something is accomplished !
happy thanksgiving to you and your family , mr. gowdy !
please keep fighting for the repeal of obama care ! !
marco rubio ... 2016 ! ! !
get with it , ted .
you sir have my attention !
you are a traitor to america and to the republican party .
i , too , would be looking for a third , conservative option .
way past time to close out borders borders
at the rate he is going he has my vote .
thanks for looking out for south dakotans and the country , senator thune .
the gop is hell bent on defunding it before it goes into effect .
the program helped ted .
why do you the representatives keep cowardly looking down and say yes sir
we need a true conservative with true family values
i wish u were the president instead of obama nobama !
we must pray for this country !
i would prefer a balanced approach that deals with both spending and revenue .
too late now-next term you are gone .
that is the only chance now to get the law repealed .
you represent the republican party and it &apos;s values .
keep fighting the fight senator paul .
i hope your fellow republican congressmen from mississippi will do the same .
if you don &apos;t like it rand you should have passed an immigration bill .
go scott
they should repeal all of the acts that this insanity is based upon .
two days before the election and paul ryan makes a decision !
thanks for supporting clemson and for working for a balance budget .
the liberals are all happy , but we conservatives are getting the shaft .
that effective immediately he is resigning
our government , the media and our enemies want us divided .
it is congress that is trashing our constitution and rights .

the border must be leak proof !
pat keep up the fight .
no money , no power !
so ashamed of boehner and the house for not standing up to obama .
they are elected to be our advocates and protectors of our constitution .
cannot they also repeal the law allowing executive orders ?
by doing so you also stood against obama .
( but leave gowdy alone ! )
it &apos;s not patronizing , it is called being a true christian .
obama has his own agenda
obama may be the worst thing that has ever happened to america .

the republican betrayal started with the cromnibus which you supported and voted for .
you sir need to step up !
these missile sam systems take almost 2 years to train on .
you and mccain deserve what you &apos;ve gotten !
obama can &apos;t stand america .
fund dhs and put up or shutup about taking obama to court .
his goal is to destroy the usa .
i love you ryan .

obama wants people to remain dependent and ignorant ! ! !
he did not care about li when he voted for that tax .
no trust is right .
this nation is being destroyed , right now , under your watch lindsey .
do you also think merrick garland , the first nominee , is outstanding ?
why hasn &apos;t he been impeached
clinton will continue obama &apos;s term and increase it .
way to stand tall trey just keep your head down ! !
frankly , i think mr. obama did our nation a disservice with his announcements .
you know the irs is a independent agency of the usfg .
ryan paul is bad news
no on the immigration bill .
i like rubio !
be part of the solution and endorse ron paul !
make it count , scott .
they should &apos;ve cut off funding
we love you senator scott .
standing with you in prayer for the families of the crew and seal team .

correction mr cruz .
if we don &apos;t secure the borders we cannot stop the invasion .
mr mike enzi .
this doesn &apos;t actually sound mainstream conservative to me .
they didn &apos;t cave from the threats , they caved because of the emails
senator rubio &apos;s choice not to support the voters choice is extremely disappointing .
i am glad to see that mccain is still speaking about about the economy .
just finished watching you on lou dobbs .

you are a true patriot mia .
listen to oboma
however , i love hearing about things like this in kansas .
ben sasse , so now what ?
and merry christmas to you mr. gowdy !
she she is utterly unqualified .
conservatives are supposed to be fiscally responsible , but they are not always so .
carson , fiorina and cruz impressed me .
happy thanksgiving we are so proud of you here in south carolina !
thanks sen crapo .
hey rand , why &apos;d you vote to confirm a jim crow attorney general ?
harvard law school would not agree this is fair and balanced
don &apos;t let ms. devos destroy kansas schools .
rand paul is a booger eating moron .
if the rumors are true we are out .
you should step down sir .
yet you supported the democrats and voted for cloture .
let &apos;s build it mr president ! !
no where just more govt control over the people .
senator- when will he be impeached ?
there is no debate !
may god bless you ron paul .
take it to the bank when trey speaks - truth !
i don &apos;t think the american sheeple are actually seeing what &apos;s going on .
i thought you could override a veto .
who is chris christie anymore ?
to all true republicans in colorado get rid of this guy .
rand , wake up buddy , this deal isn &apos;t as simple as cigars .
vote no on 2nd amendment bill !
impeach this guy
you said you would repeal obamacare .
and you sir , are an idiot .
just proves our government is out of hand
someone needs to remind him he is not king of america .
if we didn &apos;t have a spending problem we wouldn &apos;t have a revenue problem
and letting a document like the patriot act survive is also most grievous ....
i wish mccain was president !
atta boy rand !
congress has the constitual authority and duty to reign in unconstitutional acting judges
south carolina for trump 2016 ! !
obama is not taking them because this is what he wants .
we need to cut spending yes !

impeach and arrest ! ! ! ! ! !
obama got elected because of what he could promise his voters with our money .
hey there tim .
cite it jerry , prove your point !
i hope and pray that congress stops this deal and overrides his veto .
holder should be held accountable and resign , but a conspiracy ?
kris lee
you and lindsey graham should be fishing buddies .

why wont congress impeach him ?
we also ask you to oppose cloture .
your right lee get goverment out of the way of everything not only the internet
yes it was repealed .
poor rich folks , always being trampled by those socialist bums in washington .
please show your obvious courage by voting no on devos .
and richard nixon was impeached because of watergate .
you voted for boehner so you could get on with business ?
looks like boehner told you how to vote .
this is the marco america needs to see saturday !
guys , obamacare is the law of the land .
thats why we gave you control of both senate and house .
i see senators graham and mccain are having issues with the executive order .
nothing but he is leaving the white house
congressman mcclintock , spoken like a true democrat !
senator ted cruz said during interview with chris wallace .
prove what you are saying marsha !
you are a joke , little marco .

i do not agree with repealing aca unless replacement means a single payer system .
you are 100 percent correct tom .
um ... no we should not !
sick of this republican waste of time !
well , what are you in congress going to do about obama &apos;s proposal ?
think of the millions of veterans that sacrificed so much to defend the constitution .
praying for all our leaders .
thanks rand for sticking up for our rights !
do not vote to confirm devos .
president obama &apos;s health care plan isn &apos;t free .
i can &apos;t wait until he is out of office .

fortunately for you , tom cotton makes you look sort of like a statesman .
god bless you , mrs marsha .
obamacare is the law and has nothing to do with our economic problems .
your comment makes no sense mike
i believe we do need to secure our borders .
pr is a little to late ! !
stand your ground and listen to that jiminey cricket in your ear !
good for you , sen. paul .
permanent delay
that overwhelming rejection should show you how georgia citizens feel .
john mccain is wack and lame .
anyone that supports amnesty is a turncoat .
what kind of socialist crap is this cathy ?
rand is too polarizing of a figure .
good news , mike .

obama promised to run the most transparent government in history .
megan needs a man
merry christmas to you and your family senator scott !
please refrain irs agents from getting bonuses
you have the duty to stop obama from his detrimental foolhardy acts .
do not make any compromise with the illegals mr crapo .
justice roberts called the law constituional because it is a tax .
you know fiscal cliff , protecting the 2nd amendment , fighting the communist scourge ?
shared bruce .
it is the end of the fiscal year and nothing has been done .
do not back down stay on ted cruz &apos;s side !
may the prayers around this country bring gods children into one .
the senate better not let him put anybody in before elections .
show your appreciation to arizona voters by voting no for betsy devos .
don &apos;t count on it obama doesn &apos;t like this bill
marco is a doer , marco is a leader .
hence the need for a flat tax .

right after obamacare is gone , next up ryan then mcconnell .
help us johnny isakson
give &apos; em hell , rand .
hang with them rand !

trey you are the best !
i agree with tom
speaker paul ryan
it is treasonous just like everything else he pulls on the american people .
senator you need to get our schools funded now .
obama wants america anything destroyed ; as we know it !
the time to bring him up on charges is now .
some jesus learning you got there jimmy .
potus has done nothing right .
its about time someone with brains and balls goes to washington
for further elucidation and political enlightenment , all concerned american patriots should check out www.vdare.com.
if ryan was a conservative they wouldnt have him on the ticket !
the man is a traitor in my opinion and should have already been impeached .
praying it is over ridden .
congress and obama needs to cut spending
its just a show since he can veto you guys now .
put an end to obama &apos;s tyrannical regime ! ! !
power of prayer is incredible !
very thankful and pray for you daily sir .
how about you , speaker ryan .
no is on this one either bro !
keep strong mia .
good point bruce .
he is our enemy .
maybe sally yates is interested in a senate seat from georgia .
but when are you all going to have the guts to impeach him ?
talk to ice officers about immigration
amen such brave men god bless them
you are a day late and a dollar short john ! ! !
praying your colleagues will start to be as faithful !
3. no bill should be passed that is more than 100 pages long .
impeach the dummy
i believe in jesus christ , and he is about to come back ! !
we are your constituents in signal mountain , tn .
go mitch go .
boehner has become the best and most sun tanned wimp in congress .
i pray you are right .
cut the money off !
repealing obamacare doesn &apos;t impress me .
thanks for your hard work bruce .
2016 might start ron paul &apos;s second term : p
our constitutional rights are not up for votes !
the people from oklahoma can always count on you to do what is right .
you lost my vote too you liberal coward
reagan and &quot; w &quot;
you would do more good for florida by being a good republican !
we need to look at every facit of government spending including defense
why congress afraid to stop him ? ?
please do want you need to do to arm our military recruiters .
well while on the campaign trail for rubio you better figure it out
but cuba has a lousy record as well .
thanks so much and shame on mccain and graham !
rand is not .
there would not have been default on the national debt .
the confederate flag is not an issue american &apos;s care about !
repeal obamacare ! ! ! ! !
stop obama from doing this .
you represent a conservative district .
rand , keep up the good work !
mia what is congress going to do about it .
focus on the senate rand paul .
play more poker
i love johnny ,
damn liberal dem judge ...... so sorry mia ! ! !
bye bye obama care
absolute freedom is no freedom at all .
trey gowdy should be a president next
@ treygowdy trey please help america ! ! !
i &apos;m just a reagan conservative .
he is probably to busy trying to put the screw to us american citizens .
if the rest of congress were johnny isaksons we wouldn &apos;t have a problem !
chick peas and green olives senator mccain .
too little too late bucko !
you caved and america is disappointed in your choice to support the bill
god bless and godspeed !
i totally wanna visit cuba an smoke cigars
how about supporting our constitution instead of blindly sucking up to the president !
your a rino and at this point , your about worthless to me .
so , james inhofe , betsy devos bought you too , huh ?
you want to bust them tom ?
jo .... democrats want nothing to do with obama &apos;s jobs bill .
why don &apos;t you mention what obama fell into when he took over from bush
that &apos;s the conservative mantra isn &apos;t it ?
no mamen
that tells me he is doing something right .
i totally agree , congressman bob gibbs
and he contributed to obama &apos;s campaign .
we need to feel safe let the marine corps eliminate the problem .
just like congress to not understand the constitution .
i guess the previous government , should have done something about it .
if i see one republican vote for higher taxes i am outta here ! !
he wants to be pres .
let the other guy do it after we impeachment him .
carly fiorina did a superb job .
audit the fed tom .
why can &apos;t congress override him .
obama has a well informed and trained handler in valerie jarrett .
impeach him for treason and fraud , then publicly hang him
now to get rid of this illegal alien bill .
didn &apos;t florida pick trump ?
mr. senator please stop humiliating the people of south dakota .
now the election of constitutional conservatives in thehouse and senate must be our focus .
god be with you mia !
praying for wisdom upon you and your fellow representatives everyday .
in short , talk less , listen more , sir .
you bring up a valid point senator paul .
you go scott desjarlais
harry reid would have to stop funding his singing cowboys .
sounds like johnny did good
i am praying for your success down here in louisiana .
when will our elected officials finally listen to what the people want ?
stand strong with a stiff back unlike the speaker .
2.3 % cut is nothing , we need to cut 15 % at least .
personnel tax &apos;s gone &amp; replaced with a national sales tax .
oh there are plenty of valid reasons to oppose this totally unqualified nominee .
bill wilson is president of americans for limited government .
we have enough damage that has been done by obama .
we &apos;re never going to get rid of the illegals .
vote no to devos
please initiate impeachment proceedings !
i &apos;m sorry tom but you are wrong !
defund the nsa and fully repeal the patriot act .
pray you never have to deal with it .
if only you hadn &apos;t voted for ryan you pos liar
cuz hes evil
scott , thanks for what you do .
tillis
you can all of this if you pass a clean cr .
children are his heritage from the lord !
funding the troops if there is a govt shutdown .
thank god for your good sense mr. graham , we need more like you !
a third party is coming , wait and see .
contribute to the senate conservatives fund .
political double talk mr. jerry moran .
hoo ray for charleston and the people there , that &apos;s class
yes authority .
omg - really mr. moran .
rinos do what rinos do .
we need obama control
we are forced to have a balanced budget to live within our means .
we need the fair tax .
we need to do spring cleaning &amp; get rid of the rotting waste
bo has more $ to blow this year than last year .
in fact most of the border is nothing more than a barb wire fence .
hope i live long eniugh to see republicans take back all this goodwill !
would have been nice had johnny submitted the amendment himself years ago !
we need a town hall in bloomington-normal .
maybe congress will grow a spine and defund planned parenthood .
hey--you faithful conservative leader ... come home for a town hall meeting .
congrats you spineless twat .
specifically which part of his executive actions do you disagree with ?
i believe that &apos;s the way god intented .
the congress should all be impeached and new representation elected under term limits .
plus kentuckians just looooove some obamacare .
ted poe is a great conservative and patriot .
too bad the whole republican party doesn &apos;t believe that .
i have much respect for him and rand
point well taken senator rubio .
with you in congress , god is blessing us !
so find seven more and kill obamacare !
he is the worst president we have every had .
but he has sent that same message to american people since he got elected .
come south to your new constituents in dunnellon .
a position you would not of had if you had voted against boehner .
marco rubio 2016 ! ! !
wow , this created so many jobs here in the state of wyoming .
to impeach obama and get a pres that likes our country
i &apos;d suggest rand close his mouth long enough to crack a history book .
looks like they just have the federal reserve print it ....
i wish we would impeach him and soon .
i am sure you will cave like you did with the debt deal
get rid of the senate immediately !
romney is not a conservative , his views not far from obama &apos;s .
do you know that obama got osama ?
potus has his own agenda .
these american patriots are standing for you .
freedom is big business for our government isnt it trey ! !
you don &apos;t understand how the internet or the constitution work .
he has committed war crimes aiding and abetting terrorist broken multiple immigration laws .
stop giving money money to illegal aliens , syrian and cuban refugees .
we in texas are pulling for you , mia .
president obama has reduced the national debt .
and rand paul &apos; 16 !
george washington , then lincoln and last reagan .
you have not done your research , sir .
obama is the reason .
ask me that after rand paul gets elected .
even the help organizations aren &apos;t helping people today rand .
you got my vote james lankford .
close the borders please !
i would love to see impeachment proceedings after the new year .
cut obama &apos;s pay and give it to the v.a.
god please intervene , we pray .
big government is the cause of our debt crisis , not the solution .
i pray you stick to the convictions stated above ! ! !
impeach obama _ biden now &amp; save america .
posse comitatus still applies if guardsmen are acting under national command authority .
well we decided way before you idiots in washington .
you &apos;ve already proved you &apos;ll cave when you voted for romney .
this political segregation is drowning our nation !
i hope you make him cry , rand .
supplying arms to rebels in libya , egypt and now syria ?
this guy yoho has no clue .
so do something about it trey
beheaded by mccain and obama allies .
i am sure youd rather work with hillary you rino
our immigration policies are not broken but enforcing our immigration laws are !
i can &apos;t believe you voted for betsy devos .
not sure how a school voucher system would work in wyoming
dr. carson only one i can think of ! ! !

send obama to iraq and let them deal with him .
i thought more of you than that , mia .
will georgia ever ratify the era ?
even if we can &apos;t get override votes .
we dont want obama care ! ! !
civil charges alone don &apos;t cut it .
graham , i agree with your post , but am skeptical on your approach .
you should have told him that and not answered that stupid hypothetical question !
i voted mitch but not for you
congressman king , it is time to impeach obama !
cut the purse string .
well obama hasn &apos;t done anything yet .
so basically he &apos;s going to increase spending &amp; cut the revenues .
did you just wake up paul ?
rubio and rand paul ... we need you guys in the senate !
please be courageous and vote to oppose cloture .
please find a way to stop obama from sending weapons to syria .

dhs should be disbanded and the funds directed at the fbi and cbp .
i appreciate hearing from you , mia .
defund the un , please !
immigration- kicking out the illegals
you are a disgrace to support someone who is clearly unqualified for the position .
mr. mathis , were you for impeaching w. he abused the constitution .
the federal government .... hands down
sadly the balanced budget amendment shouldn &apos;t be attached to anything else .
he swore and oath as top law enforcer to up hold th constitution .
i &apos;m standing with rand .
i shudder to think of another four years with obama
ople that put you in office ! no amnesty !
he sends f16s and tanks to the muslim brotherhood in egypt but cuts our military
are we really now the divided socialist states of americo ?
he is not truly a conservative .
that idiot believes all the msm &apos;s crap and thinks he is king idiot !
hey rand how many stocks did you sell off before the crash ?
mia , i agree .
dave you &apos;re an idiot .
sincerely , your constituent in georgia p.s.
kristi noem : conservative and good lookin &apos; !
johnny , just keep your cool in the debates .
prayers and common sense .
we would like to hear of your plan to stop this lawless administration !
now please fix the obama care mess .
bo wants us to default .
compared to what israel is living with , our problems are minute .
quit fighting obama and try to do some good for the us .
cut the woodrow wilson legacy out of our government .
mr gowdy , we have no law .
the pope is too friendly to the obama agenda .
you as well , lee .
a vote for cloture is a vote to fund obamacare ! ! !
a bruce poliquin speech hits the spot !
check your political egos at the door and get our country back on track !
he hurts anything he touches .
may the impeachment proceedings begin and may god bless america .
who stood with ted cruze ?
no strikes !
obamacare is not could for the citizens of this united states .
the tsa is out of control , along with the epa and irs .
the constitution is what our laws are on .
drop out like a good little marco
i watched it on fox news channel
oh trust me they have cut ppl .
2. were honestly not going to be able to kick 30 million illegals out .
mia , i completely agree .
obama needs to be impeach now .....
i &apos;m in nc
he is a liberal republican
which group of federal goverment are you talking about .
obama is the god if the athiest &apos;s ..
just wish senator graham would do the same !
first vote showed she had no backbone .
yes and none of you in washington are doing anything about it .
bruce poliquin- how much did you spend to make this a facebook sponsored post ?
iphone lindsay
merry christmas mr gowdy you are the best /
impeach obama and repeal obamacare .
elect a conservative president .
mr. speaker , consider yourself and all of congress on notice .
actually , he &apos;s doing what congress should have done years ago .
you sir are no leader !
he doesn &apos;t want it fixed
you failed to manage the speaker .
our government has let us down .
keep up the good work scott !
no body wants to go there ! !
mccain was out to eat with obama , nuff said .
rand isn &apos;t quite as good as his dad
god bless you and keep you well and strong .
this guy does not like you , he never will !
why we &apos;re at it - are you for repealing the bush tax cuts ?
we must not let down our guard .
james , you really are proof conservatives are totally retarded .
very well stated mr. rubio .
i would rather give for gas then oklahoma losing everything
just don &apos;t vote to cut veterans pay any more johnny isakson ! ! !
americans should agree with you as we stand for america .
obamas unconstitutional orders are null and void !
lisa , we need nothing new , just enforce what is in place .
you are piece of trash mccain .
btw , quit whining and come up with something better ...
another mess from obamma admin
he and his administration wants to destroy this country .
jordan and egypt do not like us and yet you believe they do .
paul / amash 2012
tax compromise agreement should not include any provision to fund obamacare .
most on this post not from nc
good luck finding qualified teachers to go along with this buddy .
false flag operation / drill
washington politicians have let american citizens down .
earnest prayers for you and your family .
impeach his dumbness and let &apos;s take our country back .
again , so proud of rand paul and those who stood with him ............
we appreciate you and what you do tim scott for congress : )
he can hug it out with obama
no funding for obama care !
lindsey , lindsey he &apos;s our man !
mississippi is last in everything , can &apos;t we be a first here ?
the companies cannot afford the tax and the hospitals won &apos;t buy !
praying for those families affected at the church &amp; for charleston .
thom tillis is next to hear about this !
steve , this was brought on because b hussein said he refuses to negotiate .
i hope people will look at gary johnson , libertarian .
typical rino turncoat .
taxpayer money doesn &apos;t go to fund abortions .
we need to rein in the debt and cut spending drastically .
you need to say this on national tv before it &apos;s too late
if he can write what he wants and we pay him to do it .
do not replace it .
! just small town constitution loving patriots on a budget ! üòâ
obama is like a wayward torpedo !
yes , he should have been impeached long ago !
sounds like to me that obama and congress are just perverts themselves .
but ignore paul ryan , romney and the rest of the political hacks .
we are not stupid like democrats lindsey , we can read .
better close the borders
common sense would say you don &apos;t arm your enemy .
our president and congress swear to uphold our constitution .
we need more men like ben sasse .
he has done nothing to deserve the title of potus .
the government is no longer a constitutional republic but a monarch .
stand up and don &apos;t cave .
mia love you are so disappointing .
multi state healthcare - that is already in obamacare ,
a few months late and potentially a few votes short .
as well , it should be irrelevant whether a judge is conservative or liberal .
i never could figure out if lindsey was a republican or democrat .
i love trey gowdy .
now , that &apos;s my marco .
you never mention repeal .
also do you find it curious that isis has never attacked israel ?
many republicans of the house signed a promise not to raise taxes .
israel needs to wipe hamas off the face of the earth !
a balanced budget is needed .
the president absolutely wants to dis-arm us .
tom , just in case you would like a little back up .
you people in washington dc are not that important ! !
this is such a clear violation of our constitutional freedoms that it is shocking .
m i z z o u !
2. special prosecutor for benghazi .
i do not understand why we send aid to countries that burn our flag .
that flag is my heritage .
very true tom .
i certainly hope you are right about devos .
how can we make sure there is no cover up ?
i do not support increasing the debt ceiling .
has emily cain ever had to work for a living ?
there are millions of constitutional conservatives .
good for you bruce poliquin .
and to your mr .
thanks vern , for listening to your constituents .
devos wants to defund public education .
how dare you call the real defenders of the constitution wacko birds ?
he is a disgrace on sc !
yea because liberty is just &quot; wacky &quot;
) , lindsey !
i would rather kiss a toilet seat than listen to his lies .
&quot; thank god that guy from texas didn &apos;t win , &quot; boehner said .
he needs to do more about islamic extremist like isis .
keep up the good work mia ! ! !
very good statement overall , mia .
don &apos;t listen to those liberal idiots vern !
wake up , johnny .
obama is a mistake
in leaked tape mitch mcconnell admits the koch brothers are running the republican party
however the administration and congress create a lot of needless overhead .
ben sasse , the hon .
open the government , increase the debt limit and then you can negotiate .
that he hates all americans and loves all the middle east ! ! !
she &apos;s given 6 + million to the rnc and has no education experience .
i thank god for you and our other representatives in oklahoma .
our government is breaking the law and spineless bipartisan humans are to blame !
it seems obama wants to spend us into oblivion .
congrats and god bless !
impeachment he is not above the law --
best of luck mr. rubio !
harry reid is a total ass ! ! !
impeach and prosecute .
too late now , he &apos;s president
i , also , like line item veto .
you can tell mrs. mccain i said that .
they prefer freedom instead .
everyone is just sitting back while he takes over w his muslim brotherhood cronies .
happy thanksgiving , trey gowdy , to you and your beloved family !
if he is on the ticket , he has my vote ! !
ron paul 2012 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
keep trying vern .
vote no to the war and bring back the military personal already over there .
how long until impeachment begins ?
yes because obama will never do it because it would make the country stronger .
mr scott davis !
to little to late from the &apos; the speaker &apos; .
neither will rand paul , luke peets .
why can &apos;t congress see that and get rid of it .
more support for idaho schools would be great .
hope the rest of the repubs will hold firm .
come on marco , get on board with trump !
and a generous contributor to the republican party
trey for president ..... or at least ag !
good job mia love .
the bill was never about healthcare anyway - it &apos;s all about government control .
# no amnesty articles of impeachment , please .
the rebels that obama wants to aid are al-queda ! ! !
no i do not agree
ted , please vote for louis gohmert for speaker .
as always you have hit the proverbial nail on the head sen. rubio
you made me leave the libertarian party !
is that the reason you are supporting a clearly unqualified candidate ?
he said he wanted to talk with meet with congress .
vern , , , y in the heck didnt u run ? ? ? ?
i voted for you , sen. scott and often write to you .
hey ben , stfu .
i am for our senators in kansas .
and has been ignoring our constitution , invading our privacy plus destroying our country .
just like all the old guard
congratulations senator scott , proud to call you my senator !
that should have been done sooner but better late then never .
great idea , cut the spending , stop the regulations , pass the fairtax .
so yes mr. president when ?
when do you plan on bowing to dictators mr. rand paul
let rand paul stand up if you are too much of a weenie !
hey you voted for his budget , the gop is obama .
mccain , just get it over with and declare for the democrats .
senator mccain , i applaud you putting country ahead of party .
mike houser kansas state representative district 1
paul ryan wsj : here &apos;s how we can end this stalemate .
now impeach him !
shut it down till obamacare is in the trash .
illegal immigration is right up there by the top of the list .
bush had done half of this the press and liberals would be screaming .
and a veto can be overridden as many other repliers have pointed out .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re with us paul .
if rand voted for it for a good reason then let him share it .....
our prayers are with them !
i wouldn &apos;t mind seeing him with a mia love running mate .
we love you mia keep the good work
i wish you got speaker .
senator , please vote &quot; no &quot; on cloture .
i guess our country isn &apos;t about freedom anymore ...
also congratulations to greg hembree and my friend greg duckworthy
let &apos;s get the republican party together and nominate someone who is electable .
marsha , you &apos;re one of the good guys .
so ms love !
beware , liberal republicans like enzi are not friends of conservatives .
no more voting to fund planned parenthood brad !
he &apos;s unqualified to be head of the epa .
lou didn &apos;t get a chance to give &apos; em hell .
like cornyn .
finally , rand paul wins .
wow , thanks for nothing mr. ryan .
he has overstepped his authority several times .
god bless our troops , and god bless america !
we defend ourselves from obama !
deduct the amount equally from the foreign aid budget .
open your eyes if you cannot see what the federal government is doing to us
find a better conservative candidate that is qualified
i love all conservatives
no american should have to live like that .
you will not get this republicans vote towards your next election .
obama has many failings in handling the economy .
post trey gowdy we want you for speaker .
trey gowdy , you let us down !
go rand , may god be with you all the way !
god bless you and yours sir !
and why does your party always vote against bills to strengthen our school system
stop obamacare .
the only word that comes to mind is -------- impeach !
our constitution is the united states of america &apos;s &quot; ruler . &quot;
just say no congressman vern buchanan
where in kansas and for whom or what ?
behind you rubio for president !
happy birthday , bruce !
ahhh the useful idiots are out in force praying to their idol obama for guidance
we will not bow down to anyone except the lord jesus christ .
all i hear is more talk and no action .
fools call people names rand !
my condolences to senator tim scott and his family .
join hands with other true americans , the enemy is still a minority !
time for reid to be gone
what an honor to represent the people of oklahoma .
defund obamacare 100 % .
you sir are not a republican , you do not uphold the constitution .
to the honorable rand paul .. we need more like you .
i don &apos;t agree this time , sir .
tell the speaker get a backbone .
most importantly ... get rid of obamacare .
to replace congress .
to true mia
john mccain you are a great man and a great leader .
go senetor crapo .
president obama listened to millions opposed to the pipelines when he shut them down .
i am a georgia educator .
people are blaming the republican party because that &apos;s who is at fault .
senator mccain , you have been hearing from me a lot lately .
a vote for cloture was a vote for funding obamacare .
we need more people like trey gowdy in gov &apos;t .
blocking socialist ideologues wishing to pervert the constitution is an admirable thing senator
yoho , stop following orders from d.c. and listen to your ppl .
tim scott was my science teacher at charleston high - 1968 !
obama is a commie traitor and should be shot !
very disappointed in everyone who voted for boehner .
does he really know what he is going ?
rand paul ted cruz 2016
how the hell does obummer keep getting his way ? ?
that &apos;s a pipeline that would be useful for the whole country
obama has what he wanted .
semper fi patriot .
merry christmas mia and family .
elect trey gowdy house speaker
sc is a shining example of how we can find solutions .
lucas : obamacare .
the disdain obama and his ilk have toward the military is well-documented .
don &apos;t sell us out like rand !
ya &apos;ll have my support and prayers
our government has let us all down .
love ya mia wish i could vote for you .
and no one wants the irs to have any authority over healthcare .
may god give you his wisdom .
washington is a screwed by mess .
it is quite late for them to realize they have made a mistake .
rosanne fernandez show dave
president wants our country to fall on its face .
i &apos;m guessing you meant the republican party .
do no apologize !
praying for you and for them to have wisdom
and cruz has already said he is willing to do it again .
devos could not be more clearly unqualified .
senator mccain , i so wish you could have been our president !
betsy devos has 0 experience to qualify her for this appointment .
we do not even qualify for obamacare .
i &apos;ll be voting for you at cpac rand .
well done , senator scott .
so please back ted cruz for president .
bingo mia !
no one has brought up obamacare yet ....
obama is destroying america and should resign .
i hope you do because the president is not doing anything .
mike , thanks for supporting and defending the constitution ! ! !
no exceptions ! ! ! !
while anything christian is being banned in the schools .
back to original intent of our constitution .
obama needs a head check .
tom tillis don &apos;t allow the syrian refugees to enter the united states !
if you go this way then american constitution is not safe either .
i think this presidents policies are putting this nation in grave danger .
thanks for your service james .
there &apos;s no question your mom and dad .
obummer is a liar and traitor !
let &apos;s just take down the internet , marsha .
you , sir , are a disgrace to the american people .
flat tax sir .
we are sick to death of your big mouth along with graham .
rubio is very well loved in florida
most of foreign aid has been wasted on people who hate us .
how about real crimes in tennessee that go unpunished ?
congrats on the win rand !
i believe that he stands on constitutional principles .
another good resource for donation is samaritan &apos;s purse
the administration should intervene , immediately , to stop misapplication .
please , never help our enemies with anything !
no one &apos;s buying it , marsha .
senator , you sir , are uninformed .
so ... what is my congressman going to do , huh bruce poliquin ?
back to you trey goudy- wishing you and you &apos;re family a wonderful thanksgiving .
obozo cant even spell budget much less make one !
where there is no oppression there can be no pauper hirelings . &quot;
this veteran and patriot will not stand for such rubbish .
he is to flaky .. if we compromise our constitution people we loose all .
the future of north carolina .
god bless the rubio family ! ! !
go senator mccain go !
they letting there true colors shine through now and it looks nothing like jesus
im a republican , but someone should have said that to bush !
its obamas war on america
as fast as obama is moving we have little time to do so .
i guess sir we now know you as clueless as she is .
god bless you , senator scott !
he lies every time he opens his mouth !
amazing how ronald regan raised taxes about 11 times and no republicans cared .
this is not the time to cave in .
get rid of the noxious weeds in washington , d.c.
dr. ben carson for president .
vote no on amnesty !
obama will veto , you will move on and people will continue to languish .
happy easter marsha !
why can &apos;t we have an election to have him impeached ?
mr. trump : time to stop talking to the rinos .
must stop this war on coal obama has going .
don &apos;t cave into the republican establishment !
loose obama and take over .
vote this thing down , tom .
what are you weak kneed spineless cowards going to do about ?
stick to your roots brother !
congressman ... this congress needs to behave as if they have authority .
please be pro- bruce poliquin and tell me about you .
&quot; ... but our vote to repeal this failed law was necessary . &quot;
it &apos;s all he knows to come up with on short notice .
freedom is freedom to live as we choose .
i think mr mcclintock should reconsider what he calls luxuries .
this only happens if the republican nominee wins this election !
how does rubio look at himself in the mirror ?
because obama is president
just read your post ted .
stay out of syria and secure our borders !
uh , where is our leader jerry on this ?
if our president won &apos;t do anything , you have the power .
thanks , jerry .
he should not be giving money to israel .
go for impeachment if you can prove these allegations .
please register as a republican so your vote counts for dr. ron paul .
stand for the american people instead of gop establishment .
more than a few of us got our eyes opened about mccain and graham .
people don &apos;t see how it &apos;s outmoded physical therapies and conservative care .
nice spin vern .
good work oklahoma voters !
it was totally a unconstitutional provision .
lots of folks are praying for you and the tough job you face .

marco lost me as a fan 6 months ago ... sad ... still sad
@ julie - and he hates the military , too .
keep up the conservative fight !
a return to constitutional governance
perfectly said , trey gowdy .
obama is out of his mind and should be impeached now for treason .
how much did you pay in taxes dr. scott ?
and a special happy veterans day to you sen. mccain .
you are a traitorous pig rino !
last fiscal year , the obama administration allocated 18 billion to immigration enforcement .
when you raise the debt limit due to the cost of repealing the aca .
he will just veto everything you do from here on out .
the gop does not get it !
action speak louder than words , sir .
according to the us constitution , all taxes must originate in the house .
i mean they can &apos;t get budget and they can &apos;t quit spending .
we are with you 100 percent sir !
now impeach
how bad is the senate proposal , mr lankford ?
this is why i support you and yours mr. paul !
he has broken the law and subverted the constitution one too many times .
happy thanksgiving to the gowdy family , thanks for all you did this year .
refusing to fund the department of homeland security puts our country at risk .
in all honestly , i &apos;m not a huge supporter of bush or mccain .
then you all get busy and do something about it !
the somebody to fix this is &quot; we the people &quot; .
let &apos;s hope and pray this will take obama down .
i have yet to hear romney talk about repealing the patriot act .
mr. poe sir , with due respect , unfortunately i feel very discouraged .
charlie crist is a rino .
this is probably the 2nd time i have seen palazzo agree with conservatives .
feliz navidad , mia !
remove obama &amp; biden
he was humiliated by the potus and provides absolutely no leadership .
i am praying for your amanda !
no thanks to congress , but to donations .
rand , you are the one republican senator we can count on .
mr. christie has shown his true spots and now needs to be dismissed .
they are staining their pants now rand .
yes after obama his out of the white house
senator isakson has voted to support harry reid &apos;s cloture !
he has ignored his oath of office .

obama is a fool !
trump has never said he was interested in rubio .
tim scott , you are the man .
lead the way , rand !
paul ryan needs to go now !
conservatives cannot trust you sir .
listen to the people and defund obamacare .
no sir it is our governments place to hold her responsible
the president does not have the power to spend a single penny .
are you a conservative or not ?
i support the no funding for abort .
the ndaa shreds the 4th and the 5th amendment to pieces .
just watched thune speak on the senate floor regarding healthcare , etc .
every time we lose a reagan or bush i get dejected .
yall have to replace him ! !
this socialist agenda is growing like a cancer .
good job mr. portman keep up the good work .
hope you support repeal of obamacare .
haven &apos;t you heard .... white rinos are now extinct .
god bless and guide you in washington .
you mitch are a scared idiot .
seems to me congress needs to go to the heart of the problem .
i do not want to see giving in on obamacare .
please help our government stop this spending addiction .
vote for a clean cr and open the government back up .
however , mr. johnson you have voted with the democrats twice - for adjournment .
merry christmas franks family ! ! !
jeb hensarling for speaker of the house

he , as well as the others in dc , need our prayers !
let dhs shut down .
you are getting the wool pulled over your eyes bob .
thanks for all you do for kentucky
we will not be watching megan kelly any more .
if this man runs for president someday he has my vote !
they fled the island nation before the communist regime of fidel castro took over .
why don &apos;t all of you go to a foreign country and burn buildings .
make sure the borders are secure first or nothing else passes !
the president needs to be held accountable for illegal executive actions .
obamas jobs bills ? ? ? ?
what an empty talking point given to you by speaker ryan .
what are the other texas reps. going to do ?
take advantage of these endorsements , but don &apos;t let them effect your principles .
mia what are you doing to keep that from happening ?
y &apos;all have done absolutely nothing to stop her or serve justice !
i live in utah .
here is the muslim brotherhoods plan to destroy america .
i will help repeal obama care and i &apos;m resigning tonight !
so explain to all of america your vote for betsy devos .
mr. ryan is not worthy of the speakership .
marco was my first choice but ship has sailed .
beyond proud to have voted for you in the oklahoma primary : )
thune said that he will vote against it last week .
keep kicking a $ $ mr. gowdy !
please visit my website for the most up-to-date information on my town hall meetings .

mr mccain , shame on you !
history will indeed help castro stand beside stalin !
praying it isn &apos;t so .
wonder what condi rice is thinking ? ? ?
i &apos;d like to see the irs reformed right out of existance .
funny lindsey graham &apos;s office called my house i am so disappointed with him
that would only hurt the republican party .
that &apos;s all he &apos;s ever done so it should come as no surprise !
please reconsider your support of devos .
go all the way rand we are with you .
impeachment needs to happen sooner than later !
tom , you bloviate and you &apos;re full of c r a p .
in trey i trust !

team effort by carson / fiorina
rand paul , you &apos;re partly to blame .
what part of hell no !
it makes me nervous to see you standing with boehner .
he did the same , only dhs was called the ss ! ! !
do not give obama more power to ruin our country .
rhino factor , you sold out america ...
martha brooks stevenson

georgia gun owners , inc .
how is obamacare an improvement above anything ?
you must have forgotten that obama trained us well .
we have to come together and guarantee rand paul becomes president !
we love you and your family mr. gowdy
and to you and yours trey
obama &apos;s news media will not dispute any narrative he broadcasts .
i know the president is throwing out threats left and right .
delay until you can repeal .
good job rand paul !
and the attempted quick backpeddling by the obama administration .
amazing that a pretty recent immigrant family raised marco right .
he hates amercia .
impeach obama , then our new year will be joyous ..
rand paul is an idiot and is best ignored .
steve potenzone- i &apos;m praying for you !
and we will warn our children about men like you .
ryan is a amnesty lovingln
i was disappointed that you were so late to get on board .
stay strong against the obama administration !
i won &apos;t be listening to that communist , muslim traitor !
may god bless you for standing up for america .
ted cruz sucks .
you probably want to blame the meteor in russia on obama also .
all the above , stop obamacare and impeach obama !
lets hope so , tim !
so the establishment is willing to out do the peoples choice .
yep and impeachment is a good start .
i pray that we stay strong in this .
a little late
house , senate , congress , start doing something to help this country .
unfortunately , no filters to get rid of the morons !

lindsay you &apos;re not going to win on fear ! ! !
kansas kids deserve someone more qualified .
its time to wake up and support truly conservative candidates .
i am really curious to see how carly fiorina is going to do .
defund obamacare , it will destroy the usa .
the us constitution is only four pages long -- a little over 4,000 words .
please continue to fight to defund obamacare .
if a radical hate group adopts the american flag as its symbol what then ?
i &apos;ve heard levin call ron paul an anti semite many times .
rand can you see what the libyans are doing ?
that national debt could be recouped from suffolk counties property tax bills .
congratulations , rand !
you are a waste of our money from south carolina !
mitch mcconnell needs to go !
very encouraging words mia , thanks .
and the goverment can not ever rob this fund again period .
if i have to pay full price for obamacare , so should you .
since when would people in maine want to believe anything out of a california whiner
pass the zadroga act and quit playing with people &apos;s lives .
congrats on that victory , sir .
i feel that absolutely nothing will happen before the election if ever !
i support the patriot act , but you are sworn to uphold the constitution .
praying you win captain clay
subject at a time act , sir .
i am not sure what constitution you are reading .....

mike , you are soooo right .
keep it a no !
mr. gowdy is a perfect choice !
well done sir ... keep up .. !
when did you become a republican party hack ?
treason !
tim u had me , u just lost me .
a majority of americans want it repealed and replaced .
my first question to anyone spending too much money is what are you buying ?
can not believe would agree with the trader obama on any thing .
we need to march on dc and throw reid and all his cronies out .
you are delusional mr burr
i do better at praying then getting into those matters
boehner has been ineffective on getting a long term budget deal .
too little too late traitor rino !
fox just posted r. paul lower tier @ debate ! !
every welfare program the us funds is in that agriculture budget .
the liberals go on the attack @ rand paul and marco rubio !
crist is to take your ideas and beliefs directly to the people .
i really am disappointed that republicans did not stand their ground and defund obamacare .
of course we should stand with israel .
so for that , ryan , you &apos;ve earned back a little respect .
thanks for standing beside your citizens and not behind mr. obama !
this year will be a bell weather year for the party and boehner .
repeal and defund obamacare ! !
thinking rand should be a stand alone .
let me tell you how the majority of conservatives are thinking enough is enough .
fight the good fight rand , we are with you .
obama is going for broke .
impeach this imposter for treasonous actions !
it means we the people are taking our country back .
we agree on this sir
voted to ok obama &apos;s illegal immigration executive order .
thanks for defunding obamacare .
keep going rubio !
best of luck tom !
once again mike chooses party over wyoming citizens !
sounds like some so-called conservatives aren &apos;t republicans .
rubio has always been a large disappoint to floridian .
good luck getting his resignation .
we need more like you to save our liberties
marc you &apos;re awesome but governor christie has my vote for president in 2016
simplify the tax code .
happy happy flag day everyone n long may she wave amen
so far , no one in congress has stood up and said impeachment .
marco just get back up and get back in the race .
trey is a traitor too !
suck it mitch .
@ cari , it is not a payroll tax increase .
you all know by now that obama wants to break this country .
you are what oklahoma and america needs !
however , your decision to back devos is contrary to my prior statement .
don &apos;t you think you should have stood up months ago ? ? ?
praying for all the craziness to be over soon .
there &apos;s no way we are voting for socialism in this house .
obamacare is destroying america !
then proceed with the legislative process to change or repeal obamacare .
agreed jerry !
keep going rand you represent we the people !
praying now in thanksgiving !

thanks for letting us know about it , rand !
vote no to betsy devos or i will vote no to you !
a branch of his government did .
adios johnny .
you let him do anything he wants and you do nothing to stop him .
turn off fox news and rush limbaugh .
senator portman , i listened to ms. devos entire hearing .
republican party is going the way of the whig party ... extinct .
are you now a patriot or a politician ?
you &apos;ll be fantastic mia !
surely not obama !
i will no longer ever support them again .
yes , ted , it is a sign of leadership failure .
just as long as obamacare gets defunded .
we need to our borders !
we have no heros like you , ben carson and alan west .
have you stopped listening to your constituents ?
your stand is a return to traditional republican values of constitutional and limited government .
shame on the elite republican establishment .
just like senator ted cruz called it .... no backbone
obama and his government cronies are so hypocritical and pathetic .
trey your such a disappointment üëé üèº üò° üòù üëé üèº
raising the debt ceiling is not the answer .
all of the government are taking different insurance policies and not taking obamacare .
please listen to your constituents and vote no on betsy devos .
we need to impeach him
defund obamacare , 28th amendment !
defund epa and be rid of them .
glad he vetoed the project !
and our constitution will be enforced .
do us all a favor ... quit politics and join the world poker tour .
your a traitor bruce .
christie is always fun to watch and says it like it is .
mia please keep trey close and glean from him and you will soar .
no syrian refugees allowed in oklahoma .
very christian behavior !
conservatives are not like liberals .
the next step is get rid of eric holder and issue obama impeachment papers .
wish you could do something about ryan , mccain and graham .
come out loudly in favor of the fair tax .
ron paul , ron paul , ron paul !
keep up the good work senator paul !
deny devos and support pro choice
he is leaving office now ?
the manchild emperor has no clothes !
been watching gowdy ownage videos all day ... trey is that dude lol
i know obama is playing god right now with this fiscal cliff thing .
people , please read the 1st amendment of the us constitution !
don &apos;t waste an opportunity like this to defund obamacar
seems obama does whatever he wants , and we learn about it later !
send all illegals home and close the border .
i personally like mitch .
what we need is a new presedent not a dictator
i &apos;ll stick with the gov .
bunch of spineless politicians !
my vote will most definitely have to be earned sir .
mccain you low life bottom feeding traitorous scumbag you gotta go !
very disappointed in you , congressman king .
it sure doesn &apos;t sound like small government to me !
you could have had garland , someone with better qualifications than the current nominee .
obama is power hungry ! !
cannot wait until we have conservative opponents for our two senate seats .
you have now voted for the continuing destruction of our constitution .
a little late for you to be speaking out now .
reagan did not trade arms to terrorists .
i agree with rand
give it back to the good people of kentucky instead .
stand up to him and do not let him get away with it .
the voice of reason but watch obama start a war to save face .
bo they &apos;re stuck on cnn and msnbc
and now suddenly they want to cut back spending to a conservative state ?
how many more treasonous things must this administration do anyway ?
jamie foxx called obama &apos; our lord and savior &apos; .
trent franks wants to let israel take any piece of palestinian land they want .
bruce , great idea about demanding accountability .
and this is why you have no business in congress , sir .
betsy devos is unqualified and lacks the experience and knowledge necessary for this position .
please stop lying to the american people about benghazi
never should have agreed to fund it in the first place !
we &apos;ve been waiting , congressman mcclintock .
do away with obamacare .
you have long outlived your usefulness in d.c.
if clinton wins texas it &apos;s over for the gop .
listen to you on c span about the fiscal cliff .
twenty four years infantry veteran from south carolina thanks for all you do .
we are running you out of texas on a rail .
johnny its best of you stop talking .
castro was a terrorist !
senator thune said it all .
something drastic needs to be done to stop him .
continue to speak the truth mia !
they should have let it go in the first place .
they will not stop until they are stopped and defeated .
if you vote for cloture you are really voting for obamacare .
yeah john , read it aloud to the president and explain it all .
thanks james and god &apos;s continued protection in your fight .
you have to prepare yourself for the poo-slinging monkeys like christie and bush !
just another cave in
campaign contribution $ 7,950 pat roberts republican , kansas n.r.a.
mr. rubio you are just great !
irs knows nothing about healthcare .
obama is up to his neck in this as usual
congressman please stop lying for this man .
you should have impeached him years ago .
devos is a bad idea .
we will be watching and praying .
you &apos;re awesome john mccain .
we &apos;ll start on va hospitals and military hospitals .
i like trey always serious and right to the point .
obama has no understanding about our state and little understanding about coal .
mr. king began his career as a high school social studies teacher ,
probably a little too late !
it was senator mccain who threw us under the bus .
god bless the koch brothers .
impeach him fast
fire up old mitch mcconnell .
have you listened to them or have you only listened to the media ?
rand paul is responsible for the re-election of mitch mcconnell .
why is everyone allowing obama to destroy us
president obama gave 1yr extensions to others - why not to the american people ?
the best chance is the regain the house and defund it .
mr. mccain , you are the inspiration for our country in these troubled times .
dear mr. mc cain , please do not support this immigration reform .
proud to be a sc citizen !
may they stand for freedom and the constitution we should all hold dear .
quit holding the nation hostage and pass a clean cr bill
was never too impressed the way congress handled the matter .
ashley self anyone , even teachers can say merry christmas in texas !
betsy devos .
know wonder ur name is moran .
actions speak louder than words sir !
scott is highly effective .
hope you will work on others to help the house to impeach the president !
ben carson is my only choice for president .
that &apos;s not what mitch said in 2005 , $ enator !
lets quit talking how messed up the other guy is .
how about a balanced budget .
cuba has always been a threat to its own people .
please reconsider and vote against devos .
absolutely marsha !
it has given our enemies another weapon in the court of public opinon .
impeach the b _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ !
it &apos;s not part of the common core standards .
i really don &apos;t want to be audited by the irs .
to impeach obama is to charge themselves as well .
mia love , why majority leader and not speaker of the house ?
well bush did nothing either and obama is worse .
burning the flag is a cop out .
no paul ryan .
defund his ex .
praying for your family , jody .
you no longer have my support sir .
dopey more of the same lindsey .
tim just always do whatever is right and best for america
maybe thats what it takes to wake up the obama voters
senator langford please push to cut funds that allow obama to import muslim terrorist .
$ 5 says lindsey wont even win sc in primary
now , what do you plan on doing about it ?
square republican fiscal conservatives with that waste and fraud .
no more talk the talk from any of you !
proud of you for this speaker ryan .
you are one class act marco rubio ! !
i hope speaker boehner gave you a nice pat on the back .
i know and met emily cain and support her .
impeach him immediately !
i agree especially heir dictator reid
god bless you , john mccain .
finally a man of his word that is a true conservative
well sir your position on immigration is well expensive
iraq was lie rand .
mccain is a sphincter
you are doing a great job standing with senator paul senator chambliss .
you sir , just lost my vote .
we will continue to get real patriot like you in the congress ! ! !
never give this ( or any other ) president control of the debt limit .
can you not see where obama is taken us ?
take that flag down !
you forgot number 5 impeach obama !
grow up , mia .
marsha , would you be for it if that filth came through williamson county ?
we want our reps to repeal obamacare and defund it .
the government has made it financially impossible to avoid government programs .
she totally messed up supporting the embassy before the attack also !
our founding father would be appalled by how far apart we have become .
because government is getting away with murder .
... and he should stand trial here not in a military tribunal in gitmo
now please get senator coburn on board as well !
speaker boehner needs to go .
that has been his goal all along .
we need to take back our country , it is getting out of hand .
so why does he get away with it ?
would love to see irs close its doors for good !
so why is america still sending country &apos;s like this aid ? ?
bush began the massive spending that was necessary to jump start the economy .
yeah ryan , suck up to him now you miserable eddie munster looking turncoat .
paul ryan hit the nails on the head .... great job ...
this country is doomed with the current administration and the wimpy conservatives .
lets do something about it ! ! !
a mother from south dakota
isis has stated that obama and isis stand together .
i am no loner an admirer of lindsey graham .
&quot; cut c
may god bless you and do your best .
do your homework mike .
ronald reagan , all action , little talk .
barry won &apos;t have that .
fine job as usual dr desjarlais .
cut cap and balance is the best one of them all !
senator rubio , i voted for you in the north carolina primary .
happy thanksgiving to you mr. gowdy you are a true patriot we love you dearly
mr. gowdy , i have a question .
don &apos;t support romney but rubio needs to run for president ! !
rand this is the worst time for you to back romney .
and he won &apos;t go third party .
please vote &quot; no &quot; on devos .
i no longer recognize washington d.c. as anything but a hostile foreign entity .
the current administration is out of control !
google mccain says we &apos;re funding i.s.is !
fred upton = fred upton
that is exactly what an abortion is especially a late term abortion ! ! !
dhs is unconstitutional !
he wants to destroy us from within .
y &apos;all are going to scratch each others backs until you bury the usa .
grace and class , mia , you have both .
i agree he is part to blame duh !
what r u doing about ht arizona border
next get rid of 0
i believe that the government is out of control with their spending .
i trust president obama with his negotiations with iran .
i could go on and on lee .
rand paul for 2016 ! !
fit his agenda
rubio was great !
trey gowdy in all total upmost respect , could you please check into this ?
it did not cut enough and we are not taxing enough .
when are you going to vote to get rid of boehner as speaker ?
lindsey graham is just a liar .
you have now put the american people in the forefront please keep us there .
i am sure others will have some great questions and want some answers !
marco got my vote ! ! !
a cruz endorsement should be enough to boot you out of office .
i &apos;m tired of all the talk and no action ! !
good job mitch
btw , harry reid done anything yet to create jobs ?
it &apos;ll be too late to turn back very soon .
obama is the biggest liar , ever to sit in the white house .
followed by term limits , a balanced budget amendment and the penny plan .
i can not believe harper is a co-sponsor of this bill , along nunnelee .
also the one who would not return my emails .
devos has an alarming lack of experience .
senator mccain , we will stand together , sir .
he thinks they are better than americans
what does the saudi arabian flag say ?
except he has a bigger plan that no one wants to consider .
read your constitution mr. scherer .
that he is resigning and taking his family with him .
mr. gowdy 2016 for president !
i &apos;m suprised he didn &apos;t pick ted .
mccain must be going through his 2nd childhood .
the whole thing still will grant amnesty to illegals ! !
no , because republicans have sold conservatives out
ben who ?
conference should have happened , amnesty shouldn &apos;t have .
fight on rand , your our leading voice in the senate !
hey sam !
cut spending first on the doorsteps of every congressman .
flat tax no irs !
you should have stood with and supported cruz , show solidarity and support .
may god bring karma down on you sir !
9 - james bunch - died from a gunshot suicide .

carla , fast and furious started under obama .

the entire constitution is just an unecessary inconvienience to this regime .
y &apos;all control the house and senate and still can &apos;t do anything .
lets call it what it is : independence day !
praise the lord paul has seen the light
my husband would have been there tim .
we need to repeal but not replace .
rand and ron paul are our only hope !
they should all be held accountable for , and stand trial for treason .

gitmo should not be closed .
you continually give us south carolinians hope that washington will one day wake up .

even the president is implementing cruz &apos;s plan via exemptions .
my flag is flying high today !

the republican congress isn &apos;t working to end anything !
a loser &amp; a traitor .

you won &apos;t override a single veto and you know it .
one of the finest men god put on this earth !
you are a patriot
cut out the pork .
quick somebody call a dr .
how is it possible that a kenyan born socialist obama is still president ?
glad to hear you won mr. paul .
you were chosen to replace a fraud , a rino ... always remember
support for cispa would be very disappointing .
or at least impeachment .
senator johnny isakson of georgia received $ 102,500 in corporate contributions .
medicare is not government healthcare , it is government insurance .
we are broke rubio .
thank u very much for having the guts to vote against boehner .
please continue to support the constitution !
talk to the vets and maybe our country can avoid another mess .
re : education secretary nominee betsy devos betsy devos is a multi-billionaire .
to keep spending of course .
being conservative during an election year is not what this country needs .
what role does paul ryan play in this rand , we need to know
amen he is .
&quot; i think the speaker overstepped his bounds . &quot;
what parts of constitution is he violating ?
he has no respect for our supreme court and preaches false church doctrines .
you are my candidate for president you and dr. ben carson !
if not it will be too late .
was told by my republican congressman that it was for my protection .
pray it succeds
ever heard of &quot; no taxation without representation &quot; ?
please kick obama out now please .
he is a traitor to the us .... and you know it .
start doing what the bible sez bless israel !
no .. no no no no
ty for taking a brave stand &amp; voting no on cloture .
you will never be you can &apos;t even win the sc primary
obama is not going to stop .
christine - raising the debt ceiling does indirectly raise debt .
someone needs to impeach the idiot we have now !
many north carolina families seeking the best for their children rely on public schools .
don &apos;t trust obama at all ! !
if you devide the republican vote we stand a very good chance of loseing !
how can the president make special exemptions from the disastrous effects of this law ?
every once in in a while i like john mccain .
why has my visits been cut , but my insurance has gone up ?
trey gowdy would be perfect for majority leader !
a : according to one count , presidents ronald reagan , george h.w.
praying for you from texas , clay !
he is stupid at best or as bad as obama .
today &apos;s vote in the senate on the disability treaty is mind boggling .
amen , mia - it couldn &apos;t have been said better !
ggod bless mr sharon and god bless and protect isreal
i am from texas and will do anything to get him out of office .
obamacare and the giant national debt are both terrifying !
praying , praying for you too senator scott
until then , give me liberty or give me death !
so sorry for your loss mr. trey gowdy .
i will be watching , are you going to be a conservative this time ?
cruz !
did you hear the news about what john boehner and his crew did ?
vote to defund this train wreck .
get them here , then starve them - makes no sense .
i pray that god give you wisdom to make the right choices for our country
congressman goodlatte offered his condolences .
it is unfortunate that you represent a senatorial district in my beloved georgia .
are fox watching americans the only ones who are missing it ?
rand tell all the people in washington to kiss off for me .
everyone makes mistakes and that is what happened in the debate .
our liberty is under attack right now .
obama will just executive order it ...
if any of our politicians are for arming the rebels they should be impeached .
marco rubio is my considered choice for the next president of the united states .
your words are hollow , mr. scott .
go get &apos; em c. r .
gee , folks , the senate does not impeach ( indict ) .
see how obamacare is helping our people .
how about israel never signing the nuclear non proliferation treaty ? ? ?
john mccain is and always has been a traitor .
god bless you , louie gohmert .
john mccain sucks
we miss billy graham
thanks for standing your ground sir !
prayers for a replacement that will uphold the constitution .
gop needs to stand up united !
yet rand has no problem with our tax money going to israel .
he wants to pass a bloated transportation bill .
crossing the border illegally !
obama is a muslim so what can you expect .
god bless you jerry moran !
i absolutely agree with senator paul &apos;s actions .
get a bill together and get him impeached .
can something be done about obama using tax dollars to go out and fundraise ?
i , for one , want answers as to who lied about these emails .
well said tim scott
sounds like kentucky has some good ideas on the deficit .
do you job and stop him from acting like a dictator or king
you sir , in my opinion are serving your position well .
i don &apos;t have that luxury in florida except for sen rubio .
it is time for congress to simplify the tax code .
please vote no on raising the debt ceiling , without significant spending cuts .
no forign aid to anyone until the us is back in the black !
you would cave to the first one that said &quot; boo &quot; ! !
now obama you have more blood on your hands with the 2nd journalist beheaded .
no supreme court confirmation during the remainder of the obama term .
and yet , the rinos do nothing
me too .... i &apos;m saddled with lindsey graham ....
you have said in the past there is no budget .
¬∑ why are republican legislators supporting common core if the rnc has condemned it ?
this is why you lost the primary mr rubio .
harry reid is exactly what is wrong with our government .
but i don &apos;t see where the old flag comes in .
what was reagan then ... he put the gop on its head !
the usa will never cave to radical islam terrorist scum .
rand paul ur awesome but that &apos;s not how it happened and ur misleading us
marsha you are just another stupid republicunt
carly and ben .
god bless you for your service to this country .
congratulations mia love from me here in arizona .
you tell mia !
i am praying for them i hope they were not with the nightmares
how the hell is rand paul updating his facebook ?
you should have actually stood with rand or spoke up much earlier .
can someone close the border plz
mr speaker sounds good to me .
i love mia ! !
vern , we are becoming very unprepared .
assad is trying to save his country from the muslim brotherhood .
just what chairman ryan says .
rand , i support you all the way .
sincerely , patrick j. tiberi representative to congress
forever little marco in my mind-
and you would rather be on fox news ?
obama will never turn on his own people , not americans !
marco rubio i hope u help pasco hang in there-
however i don &apos;t think obamacare is the wau to go .
he would have not been fiscally conservative .
congress and all federal employees need to take pay cut .
mike , please do not defund nor delay obamacare .
not necessarily to win , but to educate and get conservatives to the polls .
jesus did nothing !
how about repealing and replacing obama ?
kasich ticket or sen. cruz and gov.huckabee ticket .
well no duh !
obama is spending faster than bush &amp; reagan and has no intentions of stopping .
21 horas atr√°s - eu j√° sabia que obama venceria .
please act conservative !
yeah , mccain .
obamacare does not allow all americans access to healthcare .
all the best from canada marco !
by the by .. does anyone remember the preamble to the constitution ?
can we impeach the president on this ? ? ?
we need to start a fund to help snowden
now you are part of the problem , you pandering traitor .
john thune one of the best senators in the nation
i am am an american citizen from tn .
senator rubio , your statement appears to address the eventual policy being considered .
hey little marco .
alternative energy , wind and solar in georgia will create jobs .
conservative and liberal doesn &apos;t have to be our only options either , senator .
rubio or christie
no straight answer was given for any question .
just come out and tell the people the truth !
finally someone with the guts to take on the system .
she is stunningly unqualified for this position .
and not betsy devos .
no , congress does not have anything that is worthy of impeachment .
i sent emails to burr and hagan also .
what have mr. sasse and his fellow cucks in the senate conserved ?
mccain , mcconnell , and you have become balless rinos .
i agree with you vern let &apos;s get it done asap !
keep strong sc
stay the course ted and not give in !
i &apos;ve written rep. rigell and asked he support you for speaker .
quit complaining and whining and impeach the communist -- finally ! ! ! !
congrats mr gowdy keep up the good work
paul , did you mean obama or marty ?
good job mr. blum , please keep up the good work .
keep it mr. paul we need solid voices such as yours in congress .
even if it made it thru the house and senate obama would veto it .
we need it in kansas .
jason , i think that some version of this repeal will become law .
oh and they think conservatives eat worse than liberals .
oh just blame it on bush !
very shameful sir
let &apos;s move to a flat tax .
i &apos;ve known dave for well over a year now .
ted cruz i &apos;m sure would join you ! !
prayers scott for you and your family during this hard time .
and , if he does so without congressional approval , he should be impeached .
praying for america under obama - worse than any typhoon !
secure the border before any type of amnesty bill is passed .
get the stupid , weak , anti americans &quot; out &quot; of d.c.
bo ( or his handlers ) should be writing fairy tales , not policies .
isn &apos;t it his constitutional prerogative to nominate whoever he wants , thpugh ?
bob we need a new speaker .
lets fix it or do away with it .
i agree john , how stupid can the republican party be .
stupid is what stupid does !
tell the potus to quit spending money ! ! !
johnny i am sure she has really been a blessing for you .
please try and handcuff mr obama .
veterans services , and national security .
listen to your father and stop the neocon pandering !
we are praying sir
and he prides himself as being very conservative .
now thats is the ticket : -d i &apos; m with you mia .
vote speaker out ! ! !
this goes against our own constitution .
belated merry christmas to you and your family sir
i can &apos;t think of anything that this administration has succeeded in ?
yes mr. purdue , we finally have a president who lies about everything .
your days in office are numbered , lamar !
budget cut idea ... remove the paid fed .
trey is tough ....... we need tough !
love love vern !
i hope the ban goes through - and you can override his veto .
we need you mr poe in the white house
you must have had an rnc translator then .
blow it out your rear lindsey , trump has all of you running ...
wait , did you just say the president did something right , congressman ?
defund blaine
rand your the man america needs
so marsha , are you going to take a pay cut ?
i &apos;ll just be a conservative independent .
i &apos;m extremely proud to live in your district congressman poe .
why not talk about irs scandal too
we need some common sense in dc ! ! !
no budget needed .
you cannot pass a border bill before you go on vacation .
i am a former educator and have children in tennessee public schools .
too little too late from you mr. ryan
sadly , not many of your constituents can stomach watching mr obama speak .
our government failed us by first secretly getting involved .
sorry christy , not from this conservative !
obamacare is not health care it is forced health insurance .
having no plan gets us more of the same .
just repeal it , we can talk replace later .
i don &apos;t remember one christian cutting off the head of a muslim .
this is an absolute travesty jerry .
it &apos;s way past impeachment time , bill .
will china send them back once they fix all the problems ?
georgia is better than this and deserves better than you , mr. perdue .
don &apos;t cave to the demands of the obama and his cronies .
you are so right marco rubio !
you are a traitor and will not be elected again .
help by supporting your fellow patriots trying to get the word out .
once again bruce you are showing why we elected you to office .
reagan agreed to raise taxes , compromising with dems who promised spending cuts .
please , i sincerely ask that congress begin impeachment proceedings .
this is not up to a president and is illegal per the us constitution .
the ga house passed hb 512 this morning .
the only balanced approach is to reduce spending .
if you want to vote along with harry reed on and for cloture .
thanks for your presence for sen. cruz !
see it thru ted !
ok james why ?
cain is another weak minded puppet .
well said mr. president-to-be-elect 2016 !
betsy devos is unfit to lead the nation in education .
thank u for all u do , to defund obama care we cannot afford it
down with obama care !
hopefully we will be calling john mccain and lindsey graham ex-senators soon .
f off mitch .
too little probably too late mr. ryan !
mr. speaker , there has literally been zero accountability for what happened in benghazi .
some of us want your resignation mr. alexander .
really , i thought he would be meeting his buddy obama for some golf .
betsy devos is dangerously unqualified and will ruin our schools .
god bless you , your husband and unborn child .
mcconnell promises eastern ky many things including coal protection but never deliveres .
betsy devos has no experience with the public school system .
as a minister , i pray for you .
wonderful mia .
this has been his plan from the beginning
congratulations , may god bless you as you serve kentucky .
! .. i voted for you johnny !
if obamas mouth is moving he &apos;s lying ! !
he just kept saying that our rep wants the aca repealed .
bravooooo ... marco ! !
why doesn &apos;t the house put together an emergency border protection act ?
you rock mia love
she has no experience just money .
everyone will pay their fair share ... even the illegals .
him and mccain can go play in traffic together .
that is the headline that the obama wanted to see .
what does attacking religious freedom have to do with fiscal responsibility .
happy thanks giving to you trey
quit calling yourself a conservative or change your position on the start treaty .
i think congress should stick with it .
how long is it going to take all the american people to wake up ?
mccain never says anything stupid !
you should be in your home state , lindsey .
take down holder , biden , kerry , and rice .
congreess did nothing now we have treasonous acts weekly .
devos is not one of them .
tom , it took you this long to realize this ?
he is doing what you should have been doing .
swim in your own sewage , mr. ryan .
mr. mccain can you explain why your name is on this list ?
obama will be long gone and someone else will be left holding the bag !
this was an excuse to release prisoners to make closing gitmo easier .
i an wacko bird !
continue to follow that course , tim .
happy thanksgiving and may god bless you and yours , mr trey gowdy .
you are a f. disgrace to ga
he should be fired for treason .
wow , nothing like a last minute decision mr speaker .
obama does not want a budget !
can he be impeached without biden becoming president ?
north carolina has no use for you except maybe as a lawn mower salesman .
* yawn * please stop talking crapo .
hey senator rubio , don &apos;t believe the lies of cnn ! !
no change in my choice .
option b -definitely !
the people of united states needs to stop him
do not change your message rand .
spare yourself and go ahead and move to cuba to start early .
he is a fiscal conservative and constitutionalist ! !
if we want change , stop voting them back in .
it is sick as is the pathetic of obama
why does the gop allow these things to happen with no repercussions ?
vote for gohmert a true conservative .
do what is right by the constitution .
yes , demote boehner .
his veto isn &apos;t the final word .
how did obamacare ever get to be law ?
it asks about mitch mcconnell and his job performance .
people for one thing , obama care is a tax .
the gop did nothing to deserve his being willing to compromise this time around .
obama breaks the constitution and he &apos;s a free man ,
rand paul won that debate not even close
good point tom thanks !
because harry reid is a stupid ads !
wait , mr. mcclintock .
yes , obama can &apos;t take all the credit !
may god bless you &amp; your efforts to protect our nation !
it appears mccain is a democrat in a republicand suit .
impeach obama and put in place better oversight of the nsa !
and btw who in their right minds would name their male child lindsey .
your out sir .
it &apos;s time for the flag to be put in the museum .
i won &apos;t do it again sir !
use your constitutional authority to do something about .
you , mr graham , would be kicking cans if i had my way .
what is the xkeyscore program tom .
cut spending , good move , i &apos;m with you on that one .
act like a republican and stop something that will hurt this wonderful country
democrats own obamacare .
fidel obama !
go back to kentucky and back under the rock you crawled from .
we are depending on you johnny .
eliminate agencies that are no longer necessary and reduce spending there .
obozo is doing an executive order that is illegal and exceeds his executive poweres .
i &apos;m with you all the way , mia !
agree.thought of mr gowdy immediately !
love ya rand ! ! !
what a great response speech by senator marco rubio !
there is a video of her touting socialist and communist countries .
glad efforts to defund pp have failed .
mo &apos;s a hard conservative and he won &apos;t change anytime soon .
he has done nothing that he said he would do .
did you have something to do with the benghazi attack ?
it makes no sense for a politician to &quot; fight &quot; against the epa .
and a $ 1 trillion tax cut over ten years ? ? ?
vote for what the people want and that is no on devos .
or , the irs and avoid a shut-down .
may god bless you , your families &amp; the usa !
god bless america and god bless you trey for your work in washington !
expect an early ( er ) retirement sir .
our constitution is getting ripped .
congress has yet to do one thing to stop the insanity in washington .
i am glad to see young strong women , embracing our conservative values .
i love congressman yoho but i was scared .
thanks trey for being a right voice !
enough with the talk talk talk .
why are y &apos;all not screaming out about this tyranny ?
awesome , praise god .
i bet wrong paul will continue obama &apos;s apology tour .
god bless you ....
president lyndon b johnson .
watergate was only about political acts , the irs affects all people .
he &apos;s gone gone gone !
gowdy is a beast .
there were 29 traitors .
prayers ~
i think johnny ritchies mom is also his aunt
awesome tom , awesome .
i have both white and black friends still in south africa .
keep it up paul , dont quick , we need to know the truth
flat tax is what we should have .
real good at talk , no bite !
good luck with that sir ...
thanks for sharing senator lankford .
merry christmas and god bless you and your family , senator paul !
we desperately need politicians that will protect the constitution .
vernon weathers obama and kerry both keep referring to it as a crisis !
obama is absurd .
get real , graham !
tim , will you be joining your 13 senate colleagues to filibuster ?
my fav , too , tim !
the presidents family , congress , federal judges , this list gets on .
before the body is cold , mitch has treasonous obstruction on the mind .
mr. mccain i have no use for you .
mr. burr , you will not have my vote .
three branches of government determines law !
is like putting the fox in the hen house .
please don &apos;t repeal the pre-existing conditions clause .
this is the only item i feel should have no tax limit on earnings .
congress is just as guilty as obama in purposely destroying our country !
we need more people in government like you and your father .
we are the third party .
don &apos;t blame it all on obama .
pray for a fast and full recovery ...
we must secure our borders .
or would their privilege as a cuban remain ?
i totally agree and i would take it one step father .
how many town hall meetings do you speak at ?
you are a patriot for voting no
i &apos;m tired of all talk and no action .
pleeeeeaaaase , we can &apos;t be bothered with rule of law and principles .
i am in your district and also approve obamacare .
praying for you tim scott i lived in that area for awhile .
a flat percentage tax would make much more sense .
6 ) kill obamacare .
he can be impeached .
if i read this below right it says the permanent placement permanent meaning cannot bemoved
for once vern i hear you are on our side .
don &apos;t repeal unless you have an alternative .
on rand baby you &apos;re still a dick
you guys allowed yourselves to be railroaded by this two bit newby cruz .
just keep talking , ted .
praying you get in !
it is a very small way to restrict the power the fed govt has .
conservatives have nobody to vote for .
the people voted for him , not the party elite .
the only red tape that john wants to cut is the epa and osha .
james , you got ours when we voted on sat .
jerry keep up the good work and fight the good fight .
where does boehner wish to go ?
please , before it is too late .
why would the president fire him ?
billy smith , everybody needs to be very afraid of obama and his henchmen .
we cannot take anymore tax increases .
legal , no !
i &apos;m proud of my flag and will always cherish it .
i repeat obamacare was never and will never be about healthcare .
you rino sell outs !
abolish all tax deductions , and layoff all irs employees that administer them .
amen , mr. gowdy , amen !
please senator mccain , do not abandon us or this country .
stand for liberty and the constitution .
indefinite detention is illegal and unconstitutional .
vote boehner out of the speaker &apos;s chair .
obedience to god and our constitution are the only things which will save america !
frankly mr. gowdy i have lost faith in you .
first it was north v south now its americans v the federal govt .
not at the same time as the jersey shoreee ... come on johnny
this is what happens when rinos get into office .
bruce you have my vote ..
if this were obama the naacp would be yelling from the roof tops !
no real american will willingly bow to this latter-day king george !
god bless this nation for having someone like you .
only watch fox news channel .
no better than the president and his cronies running our country into the ground !
congrats and best of luck this fall mia .
richard , we usually approve of things justified by our constitution .
i will accept obamacare if noone is exempt .
sen. tim scott , are you related to this family ?
russia , china , &amp; vietnam still hates america .
praying for you and this issue .. god has a plan ..
jeb bush should have been our choice !
of course , he is a liar and have been caught in several lies .
the republican party is tanking .
gimme a call mike , you have my number .
stay home and worry more about radical christian terrorists
we love you roy !
sad to say , mr. farenthold , you were not among them .
our freedom is a choice .
articles of impeachment are overdue .
wacko bird , hah , that sounds like a cartoon character .
stop blaming obama !
mia , you are a new hope for american patriotism ! !
that right get rid of all of them clean house
but our entire tax code needs a complete overhaul .
keep at them sen thune .
what a farce , once again you put the party before the people .
yeah where was he all through this thing now he wants to ride his coattails
let them spend there money for freedom .
impeach obama close the borders andd nuke the middle east ?
john mccain we need you to resist !
power has corrupted obama
the establishment lost
i stand with you , rand paul !
the president has been the one backing up all his talk .
a little late paul .
be used by god !
no , none , nada , zilch authority !
i only pray you continue to follow this path .
good job , marco rubio .
something should have been done long ago about this law-breaking control freak .
with jeb out .
im gonna wait for a comment on these comments from scott .
bruce collects on his bet with an indiana congressman .
why should he worry about congress ?
you did fine in the debate mr. rubio .
obamacare is just crap .
g steven bales once again a gop conservative thinks they know it all .
dr. ron paul is a republican member of congress from texas .
nobody changed anything , executive branch continues its lawlessness without molestation .
i am from tennessee .
spending your self out of debt is as stupid as drinking your self sober .
until obama is gone it won &apos;t happen .
continued blessings on you sir ... you are a true patriot ...
congress should move to impeach now !
answer : the enemy within has taken over the white house !
no need to apologize you said exactly what you meant and felt .
keep it up mia : ) !
i heard that you won &apos;t be seeking another term after this one .
the people of utah deserve a representative that can get things done .
or if they recess than he can do it better not mr blunt
impeaching obama would be nice .
true sir !
just because a few idiots use the flag for their own political gain .
christie has become a big disappoint , maybe he does owe o who knows ?
lee zeldin judy pepenella merrill gaines-zeldin schwartz

we the people built this government and we the people will replace it !
why should i believe anything that comes out of obamas mouth ?
we want the constitution back in our political system .
trump / cruz 2016 , two real conservatives who will work for all americans !
most of our aid seems undeserved .
i would like to see you replace boehner .
flat tax / fair tax .. no deductions for anything for anything and anyone ..
the majority has spoken volumes ben .
go get em dave .
also u do know that there are no direct flights to the usa .
no votes , no congress involvement , nothing .
but cruz cannot win and rubio i can never vote for .
we need to try him for treason on top of it .
now to vote for the denial of funding for obama care .
happy thanksgiving to you and your family mr gowdy !
donate your profile pic to the gadsden flag today and tomorrow !
congressman yoho - stop spreading lies .

hello tom
mr. graham , you &apos;re a traitor and disgrace to your party .
super , mia !
he &apos;s going to wreck the country good before he leaves office .
you , sir , have been bought and paid for .

you are the man sir
you do not run the country any more than obama .

why weren &apos;t the people of sc asked what they think ? ?
great stand for us vote no !
obama wants loyalty , he doesn &apos;t care about competency .
is the american government trying to destroy our country .
mccain is still angry he lost to a nobody ...
he is taking all away from america and what we stand for .
we need a trey gowdy over senate

sorry rand ... agree with you on almost everything , but not this .
, and we cant get it removed !
how is that &quot; sticky situation &quot; in washington dc going ?
so glad we have a strong christian man for our congressman .
i pray that you and other officials see the truth .
obama sucks and the republicans arent doing enough !
she has no experience in public schools , no experience with financial aid .
this bill will wipe out the republican party .
vote for paul &quot; s amendment on jets for egypt .
just imagine if we had not raised the debt ceiling .

i oppose betsy devos .
i truly hope you &apos;ve included time for a town hall in spokane .
oh and start the impeachment process please .
the good ole boys network is outta here ! !
tom , get this point straight .
aipac gave a ton of money to the rnc thru proxies .
i believe some of the traitors on cloture said they favored this strategy .
nothing patriot about the patriot act !
how will you implement a fix for this , tom ?
keep them in cuba
rand / cruz 2016. dr. ben carson hhs .
never be prouder of you , senator tim scott !
you don &apos;t have the authority to dig federal ditches .
why isn &apos;t the state of georgia paying for it ?
trey gowdy would be a good replacement .
a little constitutional education is needed .
flying it proudly in the north carolina sun !
anarchists are the ones who believe in no government .
grow a pair , find your spine and start putting together impeachment proceedings .
gowdy for supreme ! !
defund it and stand up for americans !
no laura swan it is not a legal law .
nice legacy for yourself , rino .
i really like ted poe !
so at the very least speaker boehner is massively disrespecting the executive branch .
bo brown , the libertarian conference is simply too small in congress .
dont sell out tim .
the republican party let obama win ... twice .
enjoy tonight rand , because tomorrow strarts the real campaign !
great job , sir .
james you all stay strong !
but i voted for tim scott all three times on tuesday .
excellent speech sir !
the constitutional republic is of the utmost importance to me .
devos is a disgrace .
i believe that is the only constitutional option we have left .
stop giving away america
kentucky
every potus starting with reagan have granted amnesty .
and now traitor kerry signs the weapons treaty with the un ?
either that or we have massive welfare fraud occurring !
and this loser president went on another vacation .
i have been a gowdy fan for a while now .
uh ...... heck no !
no libya was not a war
don &apos;t support amnesty .
stop talking and start doing something
bless you , amanda and all your family .
he would rather do business with the enemy than with our allies .
encourage mike to get it started .
south carolina and my home state of florida .... we have work to do .
merry christmas johnny .
its not revenue that creates debt ... its spending !
rand if you &apos;re wacko bird than what is bo ?
vote also against obama care
jeff , more importantly , who would you like to see as speaker .
obama has already proven that .
it was declared a tax by the supreme idiots .
yes jerry nodeen and their getting that better health care for free !
pass along our best to rep. diane black from the 6th district in tennessee !
he won &apos;t negotiate on obama care .
we already have them here !
greg , when was he speaker ?
the question is : why won &apos;t congress stop bo ?
please stand with us and work to defund obamacare .
good to see sc finally leave the 1800 &apos;s
rand is belting it out , saying it like is right now .
endorse cruz already .
i will not comply with unconstitutional executive orders !
give till it hurts and don &apos;t stop there !
we trust you senator mccain to do the right thing at the right time .
congress has the ability to stop this man and has done absolutely nothing ! !
well let &apos;s over ride the veto and create american jobs
marco gave a good counter to obama &apos;s wish list .
dumping isreal and picking up cuba and iran
freedom to make and take risks , with no gov .
we went from deficit loving republicans to mr. deficit himself , president obama .
what is congress doing about obama ?
obummer is from a foreign country and does not remember gas lines .
america needs a president with a spine .
join him or go down with the gop .
was by your office in north charleston today .
yes , and you did a good job on the irs interview too .
you work for us , not mrs. devos .
well said senator ryan
american conservatives have lost hope in both houses .
i agree with your comments rand paul !
impeachment should be on top of the list i agree ..
great decision made by utah
you are a disgrace to conservatives and you are selling out my grandchildren ! !
be serious rand .
i hope &amp; pray that is so .
one thing for sure , we know that obama lies .
me neither.i agree with rand .
you are continuing to not listen to your constituents .
great choice mia .
i &apos;m glad i &apos;m not as dumb as the congressmen representing texas
thanks for stepping up tim scott !
i agree jerry you have my support
yet another list your name appears on , lou .
when you put out a fire , what do you replace it with ? &quot;
you are a traitor and a disgrace to our country .
gowdy if you say yes it is good enough for me !
randy is right !
thanks to you and rep. ron paul !
and i live in bluffton sc .
including saying no on devos .
i like tom cotton !
congratulations , diane
that is what obama does best tho ...
lying to congress and the american people
the bad part about impeachment is &quot; joe . &quot;
christie is a benedict arnold .
good vote sir .
obama for u who vote for him not once but twice
mr mccain i think you and lindsay graham are the poster children for term limits
have a safe trip , lee .
obama should have been impeached by now !
da benghazi
you mr isakson are not doing your job .
mery christmas senator trey gowdy and have a great new year !
i live in knoxville , tn
if not the afa , then what is your plan ?
when someone takes a stand for liberty anything can happen !
reign in federal spending .
my question is what are you going to do about it ?
thee living god !
mccain you make me sick to my stomach .
fully support you , sir , from the great state of north carolina !
the president cannot implement any spending bills .
he is not out to fix the aca but to repeal the aca .
preserve our freedoms .
this is no victory .
my question is what is stopping congress all together ? ?
you represent your constituents , not the republican party
the epa and the federal gov .
very disappointed in your vote to fund obamacare .
jesus christ is the hope of the world , the desire of the ages !
time to repeal the patriot act
the largest monster in our government is the irs .
please don &apos;t repeal aca .
my condolences to senator scott and his family .
the media will do anything in their power to take down a conservative .
it &apos;s because he is telling the truth with solutions .
awesome speech james !
obamacare may not be the answer but , it is a start .
sorry marsha .
what a ridiculous dinosaur mr. johnny isakson is .
what does alaska get in exchange from the federal government out of this ?
other wise he would have been impeached a long time ago .
yes sir , tom !
vote &quot; no &quot; on cloture .
mr. blunt i await your response .
for jobs and substantial revenue for the us , please support hr2366 .
obama has done nothing impeachable .
can &apos;t say i would vote for any of the republican candidates either !
this is against the law and they need to be prosecuted .
betsy devos has no business being in this position .
your are a spineless traitor to the principles you touted to get elected .
you spending too much time in the airport shitter next to larry craig !
mr. mccain , i am a lifelong democrat .
don &apos;t cave take the high road
george bush # 2
hopefully , paul ryan will stand firm .
stand strong and tough tim scott against this so called president we have .
that is you , senator mccain .
sorry mr , scott to hear of the lose of your grandmother .
god , i hope we get someone stronger that can say no !
6 months is long enofe to do the budget .
just please stay safe sen. paul ... we need you ! ! !
it will blow up the nature of our constitutional republic .
it is not obamacare , it is the affordable care act
and we know why devos got your support .
carly florina was the best .
i have to agree with you marsha !
clearly , he freaking hates america .
i agree and will not forgive mc cain for his actions
i don &apos;t know how anyone can support devos .
good , when your done see if you can repeal obama
there will be no deductions for any reason .
and what is your plan , marsha ?
to late
arizonans vote for a true conservative and get chris simcox in the senate .
as pro-lifers we do not want our tax dollars going to abortion .
too bad the president hasn &apos;t granted anyone amnesty , fucktards .
this and sen. mccain &apos;s statement have some of the same language ...
happy b-day johnny mack !
one of main objectives of this administration is to create a borderless world .
and stop blaming the previous administration for what you have not accomplished ! ! !
every time the house tries to pass a budget , the senate kills it .
if this was your tipping point for john mccain , you are an idiot
then we can also add all of the many hidden taxes in obamacare .
it will be too late before they see what has happened to them .
government spending is out of control ! !
the president is showing no leadership .
graham may or may not be representing some special interest group ( s ) .
he has no qualifications and is a sell out
obama &apos;s not fit for it he is out classed and kerry too .
no one person should have the authority to do that to our country !
america will pay he debt obligations without raising the debt ceiling !
i voted for him and a straight republican ticket .
well sid mia ! ! !
rand is a senator .
i love it and agree that we need to cut spending .
small world from florida and california .
do something about it then rand .
very best , dave
he will be fantastic and boehner might as well be obama .
from a conservative stuck in california .
obama is definitely over-paid .
with you sir !
we need more rand paul in the senate ! ! ! !
obama wouldn &apos;t know the truth if it slapped him in the face .
we have more border patrol agents on the board than before .
thanks for keeping the conservative pressure alive .
it far too late !
i am a tn resident and am ashamed of your perspective on this .
i came here to write a message to you to defund it .
article ii section 4 of the constitution of the united states of america .
they &apos;ve already gotten the knives out for rand paul .
should we award him with impeachment ?
first impeach the president then work on your plan .
no to john mccain for anything ! ! ! ! ! !
god will bless america if we will turn to him for the right answers !
you do not care for wyoming or its children .
i agree 100 % senator mccain
obama has shown that the people be damned .
stop obamas ever growing goverment !
i don &apos;t know , rubio &apos;s parents are from cuba .
her answers yesterday prove she has no business near education .
johnny , thanks for representing georgians and speaking up on our behalf .
there &apos;s your useless government spending !
please discontinue referring to the constitution until you do your &quot; constitutional &quot; job !
sellout rino .
dr ben carson
only 1 % of the gitmo detainees have appeared before a military tribunal .
we patiently await justice for those betrayed by our government
ps : i like and appreciate you and mr gowdy combined effort .
i agree be wacko as you want , you are right .
vote no and you may save your job .
you will be remembered in history as a traitor to the constitution .

rhino alert !

obama and holder have blood on their hands .
beautifully put bruce .

good luck in south carolina .
he needs to go home to uganda !

congratulations to tim scott
paul ryan could unite the party .
obama does not care what the american people want .
its about time / may be too little to late
just no !
thankgod i will be in your district soon instead of rino joes .
study the constitution !
mcconnell put 2 billion worth of pork for kentucky in the bill .
likewise , sen. mccain .
reducing taxes and repealing obamacare .
a big hell no
a balanced budget can be achieved by reducing government spending .
quit sending billions to countries who are our enemies .
the statue of liberty stands within view of our shores .
we need more republicans to step forward , as you senator graham have done .
obama should not sue any us banks ; this is counterproductive !
sheesh cruz sasse ! ! ! !
i agree that the mandate will probably be the only thing declared unconstitutional .
praying for you and yours , jamie .
i &apos;d like to see the republican nominee pick you as their running mate
you did not represent the people of north carolina .
i hope you are correct mr. mcclintock for our countries sake .
if not , repeal it .
we need to protect our borders
kansas needs two new senators .
thom tillis has my vote ! ! !

take a stand to support decent american public schools by voting no on devos .
maine has more forest now than it ever has in modern history .
mr. poe you are no better .

don &apos;t give in , have a backbone and stand .
obama watches the world on fire ‚Äì and does nothing .
jerry , i &apos;m glad you are listening to us .
reid would have done the same .
republicans have been nothing but talk and empty gestures since aca was first passed .
senator scott , you no longer have my support in any way .
no no no stay out of it .
do you have any more stupid questions you can come up with to ask ?
then get on the train and start supporting the republican nominee .
no , it isn &apos;t you , mr. franks .
trey run for president ! ! !
priority # 1 - secure our borders !
this sneaky plan by republican leadership must be stopped !
to be loyal to one country , you are either cuban or american .
marsha blackburn is my congressman .
defund obama care then take care or the rest
i agree , he and his cronies have done no good for the usa ......
i have a message for marco rubio .
however , you always represent tn well .
chris christie is an idiot rino who should just shut his ignorant mouth .
i appreciate your effort sir
a nation that elects obama can &apos;t be a leader in anything positive .
i would rather have you trey gowdy !

god bless you sen. scott and your family .
shameless rubio , trump is still a conman a lunatic and delusional .
we appreciate you senator paul
impeach his arrogant communistic self .
repeal it and then focus on health care costs not health insurance .
islamic prayer does not belong in government buildings , as neither does christian .
don &apos;t raise the debt limit , we will handle what comes of it .
he is showing his true colors on where he stand n it not for americans
isreal is god &apos;s chosen people .

use the veto override
great interview keep up the good work
1. lincoln - 2. washington - 3. reagan - 4. jefferson
marco makes sense .
soo very true ! !
you do know that barak obama is our nation &apos;s commander-in-chief , right ?
for once be a conservative .
no compromise with our 2nd amendment rights !
passing bills that you know the president will veto is a waste of time .
and changing the american flag because it is offensive .
way to go sir !
the president does not have to have a budget nor does the senate .
congress has passed numerous environmental laws authorizing enforcement from the executive branch .
help put kansas education back on track .
have you learned nothing from ron paul .
maybe romney would have won with rubio with him ! ! !
tell that to the statue of liberty !
i simply cannot understand why he hasn &apos;t been impeached .
i &apos;m so very proud of you senator rubio .
repeal now please
so why did ms senators vote to fund obamacare ?
imho , military spending is what threatens to bankrupt us before anything else .
are you still continuing to back paul ryan for soh ?
you know he wants to ruin america .
thanks for reaching out to students , congressman poe .
i see now that you are a rino in disguise .
unfortunately , mike , you know that will not happen .
in 2012 , obama inherited a mess from _ _ _ _ _ .
if he doesn &apos;t , impeach him .
way to go rand a victory for all of us ....
this administration has to be stopped now !
getting a lot of resistance from mccain and graham : (
anyone who believes and follows the constitution is considered a wacko nowadays .
no wonder they want late term abortions .
i wonder it is flag day in kenya ?
we do not need kevin mccarthy as a replacement for speaker boehner .
the problem with leland &apos;s answer that we are the enemy now .
i love kentucky ....... https : / / www.youtube.com / watch ? v = qbn6vkleo48
john mccain did something great for once
he cannot everything he wants .
same to you and your family trey .
rand paul will do fine .
money from feds does not go to abortion .
great news , mia .
love trey gowdy ......... he will be president one day ...... i hope !
absolutely freakin &apos; not !
thanks for hanging in an not caving in like your fellow republicans !
such respect and honor i have for you mr. congressman gowdy !

merry christmas congressman reichert and family .
mr. grayson knows exactly what i &apos;m talking about !
please vote no on devos -
god bless you and your grandfather sen. tim scott
impeach the lobbyists .
we need a balanced budget amendment to require future administrations to control spending .
he told the lady in town hall obama was not muslim .
god bless you for your service : )
i guess rand paul is the kind of guy that likes his own posts .
then bush
not a yoho fan ...
he is an obama puppet !
not too late to stand with voters .
state of s. c .
sad that north carolina voters just reelected this man , shows ignorance rules here ,
tim , u r right on bro .
where was sen cruz !
shame on you roy blunt .
your not missing anything lee .
that is why rand paul of ky. filerbusting was in congress for 11 hours .
10 trillion in new debt !
i wonder why this didn &apos;t happen during the bush administration
a flat 8 % tax across the board on everyone no deductions ! !
obama should be fired .
lacey remember the song god bless the usa !
senator mccain , donald trump has got to go .
who holds the purse strings congress ?
arrest him ! !
end of problem except for the impeachment of obama !
what is the plan to replace the aca ?
how about our constitutional rights ala 2a , sir ?
we at war , take the gloves off , and get rinos out .
paul , cruz , rubio are better men than you .
san antonio for mia !
we need more people like trey on both sides of the aisle .
correct vote , sorry you did not prevail with common sense .
it is now time to defund and trash obamacare !
u and ur same sex senator lindsey graham should just step down !
why are we letting these bastards dismantle our constitution ? ? ? ?
getting rid of obamacare would be great , though .
you sure aren &apos;t listening to your constituents .
you should charge obama and kerry with treason !
stupid govt spending !
thanks tim we like him
now don &apos;t go there and act like a rino !
you agree with most everything he does &amp; says .
and a cr is not a budget .
obamacare is a tax , so just stop funding it !
i &apos;m voting for cruz .
they are the worst self serving bunch at the top .
so thankful for your walk with our lord and your service , james .
kinda late .
you have it absolutely right , sir .
he disrespects the american nation as we the people would like it to be .
go get them lee .
we no longer feel the need for the irs .
clearly this is an evil soviet plot to destroy the american way of life .
support ron paul for real change for the better .
in americans world you mccain bo and hillary are the real bad guys !
but first secure the border .
trey gowdy upholds the constitution and laws of the land .
might be too little too late .
the next one ... reason : because he won &apos;t be mr. obama !
love lindsey graham .
is it to late for america ?
oppose cloture on the cr .
rubio , politically , you &apos;re dead to me .
merry christmas and may god bless you in every way possible .
tn wins , and clemson , too !
another jerkoff mccain lmfao !
we need to cut the debt as well .
impeach the irs commissioner , for starters .
praying with you diane ranker riesen
so lets see mitch if you stick to this ! ! !
execute them if obama commites treason .
don &apos;t fund obamacare or raise the debt limit !
sorry for your loss trey gowdy .
use the authority that the constitution gives you .
president obama has no legal right to issue executive amnesty !

why didn &apos;t obama put a stop to that !
you just lost my vote in the primaries .
mia , you are spot on !
the folks stand with israel .
defund obamacare entirely !
america is sinking fast !
obama is bringing the enemy onto our shores ; to our doorsteps .
we the people are behind you mr .
if any answer is no you don &apos;t go .
they now have proof obama does not even have a birth cert .
boehner is not with us .
the ryan plan certainly wouldn &apos;t do anything to help with filing taxes .
no compromise with the dumbocrats
senator mccain you do know we are a constitutional republic not a democracy ?
jaime , stand firm and defund obamacare ! ! !
obama is setting his people free
it is time you start to listen to your constituents .
yeah so why hasn &apos;t obama been arrested ?
a flat tax should do it , not to mention a balanced budget amendment .
in large numbers we are saying no to devos .
despite the difference in ideology , oklahomans should welcome the president .
we also live in north carolina and insist you do not vote for the fla
have a blessed thanksgiving sir
you haven &apos;t been able to win within a more conservative environment than today .

nooooooooo lindsey big mistake 11 / 6 / 2018
what is taking so long to get this dictator impeached ?
rubio seems to be the last principled conservative left .
i wonder if he will use the same pen reagan used ? ? ?
i agree that talk without action by congress is becoming a joke .
flat tax and scott i have a question .
you should step down sir and hand the leadership position to someone with some loyalty
next .... obliterate obamacare .
thank senator enzi , for voting no on cloture .
mr. gowdy , i have been watching you .
you , sir , and your good friend sen mccain should be ashamed .
and pass an immigration bill .
you seeing correct tom
your a really big dreamer tom .
so , essentially , one sixth of the people want what he wants .
obama is going to give us all free stuff !
some of us have read mccain &apos;s and graham &apos;s press releases .
you lost my respect and my vote when you went after rand !
so , ben , i volunteer until a better candidate steps forward .
mccain &amp; graham are being childish jerks !
congress is responsible for what obama does .
that he hates america &quot; .....
you are forcing us to listen to doug left over at ksl .
can you explain your giving in on the spending bill ?
states and especially wyoming .
thanks for being for the people rand paul .
i want increased taxes to balance the federal budget , not your bloviating .
impeach impeach impeach impeach impeach !
if you want to stop the flow , cut off the money .
how about jerry brown ?
and we remember how you and roberts rejected aid to hurricane sandy victims ....
to little to late ryan .
shouldn &apos;t american taxpayers hv priority over illegals ? ?
just defund the entire agency .
especially a mistake made because someone didn &apos;t think !
praying for you and your soul .
you must not understand the big picture on sending aid to egypt .
paul ryan has helped hillary clinton win .
our current white house administration is an embarrasement .
why are you not asking the administration why his plan is crashing , literally ?
that is what he wants .
please do rand - you and a few other are our last hope !
the constitution has been eroded for far too long .
we lose again because the republican party cannot unite and get things done ! !
merry christmas , and god bless you .
i thought for sure oklahoma would stand with rand but
vern , you &apos;re an idiot !
no betsy devos
first the republican party needs to get rid of a traitor like ryan .
it &apos;s your duty to the house and to the republican party !
keep the faith tim .
mia this is a terrible deal , please oppose it with everything you have .
the overreach and unaccountable authority of the epa needs to be addressed .
rand paul and ted cruz will win this fight
and this was supposed to be the savior of the conservative movement ?
i hope this endorsement is not too little too late !
voting no !
support our constitution !
to repeal all the damage congress did in 2012
god bless you rand paul !
a little late to the party ehhhh speaker ...
morsi and and blind middle easter man were supposed to be swapped .
senator mccain jumped the gun in making this statement .
you , cruz , and trey are my all time favorites .
senator paul , look who is calling you that .

gitmo would be appropriate !
ty trey , we need more in congress like you sir .

ryan should be speaker of the house ....
if anyone can wake up the senate , it is rand paul

south carolinians have long memories , just go ask david beasley ...

i think we should keep the stand for liberty going .
like you follow the will of the people tim scott !

the epa should be abolished or brought under the control of the congress .
impeach this mother now .
holder &amp; obama would make sure of that .
give &apos; em what for , tim .
if you vote yes you are a traitor !

bring home the win rand !
it hurts to see all the elected not stand behind someone the people wanted .
defund all the things ! ! !
and judges most certainly need term limits !
watch for a lot of promotions , especially at the irs .
take action and get our military to detain obama under charges of treason .
my aim is not to pass laws , but to repeal them .
trey gowdy , i see you as a man of integrity .
trey gowdy where is libya &apos;s gold ?
@ lee .
impeach him then .... he is a law breaker .
another reason for the cr is to prevent the reducing of unnecessary spending .
have the speaker start impeachment paperwok if the president defies it .
god is great isnt he , congrats james
did pray for your friend .
he wants more taxes so he can fund the unfundable obamacare .
type in &quot; is marco rubio eligible to be president . &quot;
does what they &apos;re told like good little communist .
well tim what is your plan ? ? ?
well said james crawford
a balanced budget tied to gdp requiring a super majority to raise taxes .
this preamble is what makes the constitution a liberal document .
you &apos;re a rino !
senator paul - you are a true patriot !
the government doesn &apos;t have the authority to force people to buy health insurance .
senator paul stands with us .
we , the people , will not back down ! ! !
you are a disgrace to sc
he put his country first but put his family first also .
it &apos;s because castro took american property when he nationalized the country
boom allen may christian shelton may harrison allen may chris kelly
no money from us for any country

please defund obamacare and oppose cloture .
everybody agrees the irs is no good !
rand paul is the only republican presidential candidate worth voting for in 2016 .
and i am a registered republican .
conway , sc
it would limit federal spending to 18 percent of gdp .
obama is the worst president in us history hands down
taliban ted

any senator that &apos;s against rand is a traitor .
christine what exactly is obama getting away with ?
however , america is a nation of laws and principles .

sad thing is nc will put him back in office during the next election .
i &apos;m a conservative first and foremost .
a cause for ideas : d maine ! ! !
mccain on putin : &quot; a murderer and a thug . &quot;

not true kevin
they should have stopped him by not voting for him !
mine too tim .
dear mr. mccain , please vote no on devos .
traitorous to the constitution
you had and will have my vote again , sir !
they pass this and obama signs another executive order exempting them from obamacare again .
we are praying for you and john !
look at rand paul and ted cruz , just as an example .
recall mccain and flake , traitors to americans .
agree , mia !
hypothetically lets say rand is 99 / 100 and cruz is 89 / 100 .
you make me sick mccain .
the reason obama &apos;s executive amnesty has not cleared the senate is ted cruz !
lindsey , you are done !
please represent the will of your constituents and vote no on the amnesty bill .
go get em marco your the man !
he has made the constitution unconstitutional
so far the debates are interesting .
you should have been saying this months ago instead of doing your little pout .
blaine , whatever your name is , ?
the fbi interviewed the orlando terrorist at least twice before he massacred 49 americans .
if immigration bill is passed we are a communist country ... one party .
rand , i &apos;m praying for you buddy .

james langford please talk him into letting u s sell oil !
tim scott , what exactly do you define as being a minor infraction ?
please vote no on cloture !
or so obummer can implement martial law in texas !
no one i know wants this mess .
obama is the elected president of the united states .
unfortunately these bills don &apos;t stop him and he does what he wants anyway
good for marsha blackburn .
you must stand strong against obamacare and socialism . &quot;
obama is just so uninformed .
rest assured , our current government is the one our forefathers warned us about .

if a flat tax is not possible , then consider a v.a.t.
you are awesome , mr .
pass the zadroga act # worstresponders # endthefuckery
repeal it first , and all other conversations should be discussed after that .
only the conservative groups can get this necessary item put on the table .
it will be the death nail for america !
there is nothing fake about mia love !
praying for all of you , james .
remember how the aca passed with no republican support ?
my question mia love , who will you endorse ?
this should have been done seven years ago !
senator lankford , finally something we agree on ! ! !
i pray god gives he and his family strength during this very difficult time .

government needs to get out of healthcare , period ! ! ! !
alexander will be voted out of the senate if he supports devos .
mr. paul please do not let the irs scandal divert your attention from benghazi .
we the people need to impeach him ! ! ! !
excellent point , mr. paul .
nc should also consider the right-to-hire / fire law .
trust me , i get cutting spending .
i agree , but what about over tax satin with reputation and wasteful spending .
don &apos;t you understand what no means ?
it &apos;s past time for congress to stand up to king obama .
we have to be happy to get rid of obama to preserve the republic .
keep focused and stick to your agenda and don &apos;t look sideways .
don &apos;t give our money to other countries
states should control non-privatized land within their boundaries , not the fed .
i really like rand paul .
marco , you did an outstanding job at the debate !
he is the republican nominee .
this is an absolute travesty and a disappointment to all of your sc teachers .
yes sir , i do agree .
senator enzi , please retire .
rubio / romney 3rd party !
don &apos;t open your mouth against obamacare or ted cruz because you are worthless .
i don &apos;t always agree with you , senator mccain .

why do jobless americans lose their benefits , but illegal aliens never do ?
obama issued his execvutiv
it is time for them and the irs to go .

defaulting on the debt is unconstitutional .
you have made history by speaking for the people and defending the constitution !
may our lord continue to bless you .
an equal property tax in nebraska would be $ 1600- $ 2000 .
no amnesty = illegal immigration .

it &apos;s the cloture vote that matters .
that is what the majority of your constituency wants .
sign obama and his family up first .
lindsey grahams double-speak status : 172 likes over a few hours .
posts like this do absolutely nothing to fix the problem you helped obama create .
the budget will never be balanced
washington needs to direct the educational standards .

empty promises , he can talk the talk but can &apos;t walk the walk !
senator mccain this is not a political issue it &apos;s a humanitarian issue .

do not allow the liberals in washington to spread their lies .
we need to close our borders asap !
obama is a weak loser
good job marsha !
stop wasting our money and let us have affordable health care !
obama isn &apos;t to be feared , he &apos;s to be attacked .
mr. gowdy i thought sit in and shut down was against house rules .
why wait til now ?
defund it or be voted out
hey patriot !
did you see how our congress and senate repealed the patriot act ?
happy easter congressman an family &amp; 11th district
i &apos;m voting libertarian
texas gov .
the only thing scarier than an obama administration is a biden administration .
john thune has new friends :
no obamacare for americans !
our current business plan is set up for failure .
we &apos;re thankful for you mr. gowdy !
republican oklahoma senators inofe and coburn voted against giving fema money last year .

senator isakson - don &apos;t give up on this country !
all it takes is a balanced budget
i just want to know why you voted for the cromnibus bill
just don &apos;t remove me from my ag committee position mr. boehner !
you should have been supportive of trump months ago !
you and devos have no experience in this situation .
senator paul and his son should immediately retire from politics .
common sense republicans seem to be a huge problem for the gop .
more borrowing , spending &amp; no real cuts .
rand - this may be the moment you were born for ... # bundyranch
they removed the law prohibited our government from propagandizing us citizens .
seems like you only vote no for bills that are going to pass anyways .
hut , two , three , four ...... all conservatives get in step ! !
i &apos;ll vote wacko all day long !
since then , you and the republican party have left me .
we are definitely proud of you rand paul !
sasse = üëé üèª üëé üèª üëé üèª
what should be destroyed is the nsa and the irs .
thanks to you , the constitution is now up for &quot; debate &quot; .
will now begin praying with a dedicated purpose .
wish we had more like you rand representing us in our government .
1000 % agree with you mia !
marco , shut up .
right why aren &apos;t the elected people in congress doing something about it .
next up ... ted cruz
create a problem , propose a solution , increase budget .
i think everytime obama opens his two lips it &apos;s a waste of time .
i pray for it .
you have failed sir .
he also gave the muslim brotherhood several of our fighter jets .
you can do it rand paul .
let &apos;s not forget that paul ryan secured his seat in congress , also !
obama needs more people on &quot; assistance &quot; to gain more votes .
you are bypassing the entire subject of amnesty in your statement ...
getting the government out of the free market .
praying for you and your loved ones senator tim scott ... &lt; 3
.... yep
well said , senator paul !
our nation is a strong nation and we have been tested before !
the senate has given a clean funding bill .
thanks donald thurlo jr . , buhl , idaho
no military assets to defend american soil !
obama doesn &apos;t want to fix it , he wants to wreck it .
stop giving our money to others take care our own
but , lindsey graham &apos;s stand was more straightforward .
he and his family vacation and spend our money like they are royals .
lou when is the truth going to be told to the american people ?
may the lord go before you and guide your steps
don &apos;t give in to obama care .
congressman lankford , please hold the line on conservative principles .

remember the wars that mr. bush got us into ?
you &apos;re such an asshole rubio .
his resignation effectively immediately !
the importance of setting fiscal conservatism first .
thanks for not being a sell out sam .
get some guts and vote no !
depressing though that harry reid and the senate won &apos;t let it through .
wat right on this thought tom , thanks !
buck up and resign !
a conservative is one who wants to keep what &apos;s rightfully his .
general breaks the law by lying under oath to congress !
betsy devos will be a disaster for children across the country .
there is a conservative party .
god daily bless all teachers and school personnel .
this is a false flag and must be stopped .
you sir , and mr. chaffetz , are my heroes .
it will be the same in cuba .
not surprising that our economy is not performing well despite huge government spending .
&apos; tis sad , rand paul , so sad .
amen brother , thanks 4 u &apos;r support ted ! !
we need to mind our business , not theirs .
i wish you guys would impeach ombama
no lou , he can &apos;t be trusted .
so what is your plan tom ?
the epa is protecting the water supplies of 117 million people with this policy .
he just seems to keep getting away with it !
i propose a low flat rate sales tax across the board .
everyone said this would happen why doesn &apos;t congress listen to the people ! !
you know irs and nsa are only the tip of the melting iceberg .
while you are at it get rid of dept of education ....
if you don &apos;t like thune then don &apos;t vote for him next time .
you are not a hero , you are dam traitor .
he really does think &quot; we the people &quot; are stupid .
mrs devos is clearly unqualified .
cut overall spending and set time limits on entitlements .
what a wimp and a traitor you are to your party .
you should of been on board a long time ago
i veto mcconnel and ky
i &apos;m surprised this sales tax deduction isn &apos;t getting more attention .
i also want answers to the benghazi fiasco .
no , the first responsibility of any american president is to defend the constitution .
enjoy every moment mr scott !
sincerely , a fellow conservative , mr. john gadomski
88 % he wants congress to lay down and give him what he wants .
it &apos;s not ok what obama and his gang is doing .
-- mitch mcconnell
don &apos;t just listen to your constituents , listen to the everday people .
should have never took it away ! ! ! ! ! !
well his fathers not , get on board or enjoy socialism
reid is looking to allow 20 million illegal visitors become citizens .
time to vote this man out apparently was not listening to his constituents
i ; m beginning to think he actually believes the stuff he spout .
agree 100 % with mia !
i &apos;m with you , tom .
impeach him if he uses executive orders for gun control .
south carolina should be very proud .
anything funded with tax dollars needs to be cut .
sensible sir
impeach him on breaking our laws .
prosecute and defund .
rino is the name you have earned ; republican in name only .
vote paul ryan out

stand up for liberty rand ! ! !
amen marsha , you told it right .
you and your father make this country proud senator paul .
john boehner is protecting obama and he needs to also go .
no federal money is used for abortions .
mr. rubio , sad to read you are placing hillary in the white house .
don &apos;t let them take away our freedoms by only giving us alternative facts .
this treaty is dangerous to american families and will damage america !
great post lee .
the president hates america !
we &apos;ve got to nominate romney .
may god bless all of you !
standing with you senator tim !
he can fool you but he is not going to fool me .
nope 1000 better places to spend the money
no amnesty then
also , what about &quot; life , liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness &quot; ?
keep fighting , rep. love , we got your back .
does it matter when kerry gives egypt 250 million in aid over the weekend .
on deck : ndaa - patriot act
mia love , you are one fantastic lady !
tom mcclintock is not one of them .
how come congress doesn &apos;t do anything about it ?
where have our tax dollars gone ? ? ?
cant wait for you to vote on term limits
harry reid is not the only one elected by the people .
jeezus , you have absolutely no integrity !
i pray for you often ü¶É
another president was impeached but he still remained as president in the wh .
i &apos;ve met this young man and know what a fine christian he is .
he took many liberties away .. the same ones obama has kept going .
did you vote for the continuing resolution to allow the debt ceiling increase ?
we love you and respect you johnny i
a fair tax would renew this country .
that is where government is useful and valid .
unequivocally , that person is not betsy devos .
all of my family in nc voted for you ! ! !
use your authority and stop him ! !
why would you want to defund something that is beneficial for americans ?
if the president violated the constitution , impeach him !
god bless you and your family always ! !
can &apos;t say the same for betsy devos .
can only use drones on americans on american soil .
but hey ted , what the heck are you going to do about it ?
we trust you mr. trey gowdy ! ! ! ! ! !
truly believe obamacare will destroy itself .
you tell him , rand ! ! !
tom , that &apos;s how we arrived at our current state
mitch got a back door agreement if he caved .
paul ryan you are weak !
hang tight so obama &apos;s lawlessness will not prevail
god bless you and keep you safe ....
when are you going to resign .
what a disgrace you are to utah .
i agree david ... impeach obama now ! !
nothing here talks about why you voted how you voted on the amnesty bill .
it is ok to be right and a &quot; wacko bird &quot; .
i &apos;d vote for mr. mcclintock any day !
mr obama &apos;s exact words are &quot; this would not be an open-ended intervention .
stop the political posturing , and get the zadroga bill passed permanently !
by the smallest of margins
rand paul 2016 ... its on my car &apos;s bumper ; how about yours ?
he didn &apos;t give amnesty !
obummer does not follow the constitution !
its too late and you know it .
happy birthday ron paul
sir i say impeach him
wish we could end the do nothing era of ryan .
same old hot air with no substance .
betsy devos has no qualifications for the position of secretary of education .
he only knows how to destroy our beloved country ! !
another spineless politician that does not care what the people think !
i got my hours cut and lost my insurance before obama care .
so cutting wasteful spending won &apos;t get the job done .
they are clearly the enemy since 9 / 11 .
can you say impeachment
just read the ryan document .
please do not confirm betsy devos .
another example : mccain &apos;s salary .
i know that you are trying to represent us in kansas .
once again do your job and represent the citizens of north carolina .
he has cross the line many times &amp; yet nothing has been done ...
you and lindsey are cute !
we continue to pray for you often .
coburn is disgracing us .
there &apos;s no need for a balanced budget .
i like your stance on this sir .
he wont listen he &apos;s a socialist idiot ... one of lenin &apos;s offspring !
you wake up and your family dr. is not on the list .
i didn &apos;t vote for obama .
he has acted within constitutional authority regardless of what repubs say .
obama overall is hurting americans big time and his obamacare is hurting americans worse .
too little , too late , mr. ryan .
praying for you &amp; your baby .
easy , with a spineless congress .
duncan sc says it &apos;s &quot; spot-on &quot; .
boehner and mcconnell need to put down the scotch and grow a pair .
did you actually donate your salary lindsey or was this another lie ?
god bless him for standing on the truth !
obama is in desperate need of cash to disperse to our enemies .....
only obama does these sort of things !
too bad i waited too late to try to change it .
finally richard .. but .... maybe too little too late !
he lies so much he can &apos;t keep up with the lies .
i hate obamacare .
he wants to lead us off the cliff .
how many calls did you receive for / against the amnesty bill ?
likewise , mia .
you sir have betrayed us all in who believed in you .
love ya scott your the only one with any balls !
our government is broken and broke !
james , mr. nixon was impeached for having papers taken , known as watergate .
thomas jefferson
supporting devos is a bad move .
why are you supporting obama arming known terrorist ?
and c ) he is incredibly arrogant
all you politicians took a pledge on that stage to support the nominee .
explain sir , if you would .
she has absolutely no experience in our public schools .
there needs to be a special prosecutor assigned , because holder is compromised .
up to you and the gop to stop or defund him ! ! !
you and graham need to relax and let the president fulfill his campaign promises .
the rnc makes me sick .
and you support rubio ! !
while your at it senator take the time to impeach trump .
this whole administration needs to be impeached and everyone needs to register independent ! !
no more taxes !
this president is a disaster and a menace to the united states of america
not by a president established when they first screwed the constitution .
why hasn &apos;t obama been arrested for treason ?
too bad you haven &apos;t been on board all along .
don &apos;t let our govt .
a flat income tax in combination with a national sales tax .
merry christmas to you and yours mr. gowdy and happy new year to .
business wants predictability , business wants lower taxes , business wants fiscal responsibility .
supreme court already ruled on it , jerry cartwright
read your constitution !
can &apos;t wait to vote for rand paul tomorrow !
sheri kerley on what grounds does he need to be impeached ?
troy and i will continue praying for you ! ! !
every time he opens his mouth , his nose gets longer !
these military were provoked by muslim brotherhood and they fired back ! !
ron paul &apos;s idiot son .
rand paul big thanks ..

cnn + fox news = evil

justin amash we support you 100 % please do not sel out like rand paul
you and senator senator ted cruz are great patriots .
the division of power is working exactly as our founding fathers intended .
you , mccain and mcconnell are poster children for why we need term limits !
gop senators talk only no guts to take action neither does the tea party .
can the real leaders in american please stand up ?
you are a fool isakson
rand paul for president someday ! ! !
don &apos;t back down you wacko bird .
mia we need you in washington and we love you in utah .
i think if a conservative breathes it makes liberals mad .
i &apos;d rather be called a wacko bird than an idiot !
i agree with rich` , gail` and the many others that support online poker .
you and mccain say you proudly support the give america away bill .
right ... nothing is obama or his administrations fault .
abolish amnesty bill .
most of america wants us to get our debt under control .
we are very proud of you , mia love .
merry christmas congressman gowdy and family .
just like anything else concerning his take on foreign affairs lately .
extremism or impeachable acts from either party is not what america needs .
however he was impeached for his cover-up that didn &apos;t cost one life .
you are doing what god wants you to do .
lindsey , many believe the same about you .
they would of never voted for boehner either
tom mcclintock calif. mark meadows n.c. luke messer ind .
your job is to listen to your constituents .
rand , ryan , and rubio .
this presidential term can &apos;t end soon enough lee !

very poor , self-serving decision on your part mr. enzi .
i really like rand paul but believe the media would crucify him .
i ho0pe he holds his breath until the dems cut spending .
greg will you also support term limits on all congress and senate ?
he couldn &apos;t even look at romney .
that he is leaving the country and never returning .
learn to listen to your constituents .
that &apos;s what obama and his crew are good at .
immigration is not broken , securing our border is broken .
tim , you did a nice job getting a conservative message out .
if dollar printing is all we need .
add sen. rand paul .
he is a liberal progressive , just like obama .
you need to resign ! !
i pay cigarette tax whats the difference ?
semper fi congressman bridenstine .
keep your nose on the aca and vote to defund it .
i bet it does not stop their vacations .
bless you fine patriot .
sending prayers from kentucky
how about starting articles of impeachment against the president .
he wants to strengthen our national defense , our borders and our economy .
maybe it &apos;s truly time for a third and fourth party .
i agree tony , but the problem is , they can &apos;t spell .
other than he is un-american and a traitor .
god bless you mr. gowdy and your family this year and years to come .
thanks , ted , for continuing to be our voice .
obama is about obama not the what &apos;s best for the usa .
please stop being a rino and get america back to work

apply all the facets of obamacare to the congress that pushed it through !
you are wastefully spending tax money with ease i bet you are thankful
i become more and more discouraged as a georgia voter .
no do something about it .
represent tennessee first not the republican party .
impeach him already ! !
keep on fighting the good fight diane .
but withholding or cutting aid significantly will send a message .
you and lindsey are a disgrace to this country and your party ! !
well i can tell you that mr lamar and gov .

conservative is the answer , not go-along , get-along .
reid is obamas lap dog .
the world is watching and waiting , sir .
poor rubio .
ted , can we please see all i your emails from 2013 ?
he just will not quit doing that .
unless of course it is to give other peoples money away by force .
impeach obama ... there have plenty of grounds for it .
james , love you from your campaign &gt; but please do something in washington .
do not let harry reid stand in your way .
fuuuck obama

obummer and hildabeast for prison
john mccain is a collaborating weasel quisling .

morons , write in ron paul and obama wins .
just waiting to see which rinos cave , mitch mcconnell .
ms. devos is in no way qualified to lead the department of education .
if we remain divided as a nation our forefathers tell us we will fall .
move out of the way ryan .
senator paul is unequivocally wrong on this .

the republican party will never be the same !
i too support this and all your efforts senator paul .
oh mia ! !

bad information in bad information out sir .
devos has no experience whatsoever in public education .

the constitution supposedly guarantees this already .
securing our borders - is the law too .
waiting for some relief ; ) or reagan
your talk is worthless .
you need to do your job now and defund obamacare .
dollars would have been better spent figuring out solutions to the real problems vern .
i love you so much mia ! ! !
i can &apos;t think of a worse candidate for nevada than rubio .
you all have lined up behind everything the new administration wants to do .
by the way , did mccain give you permission to speak ?
i &apos;m a great admirer of yours , a true patriot and american hero .
that &apos;s not going to stop him !
hold your ground , mia !
stop giving illegals the incentive to stay .
why not just declare wwiii on our deadly national debt !

the dye is already cast rand .
i will pray for tim and family
mccain sucks

barry is going to cuba next month .

tom , i hope you read this .
obama is a layer .
be honest , bruce is not writing these posts .
it kills enemies
it is , &quot; we have no strategy . &quot;
bill you are not running against president obama , you are running against landrieu .
what a different country we would have if some conservatives became teachers .
south carolina need to get rid of this slug ......
this is what it means to be a conservative jurist .
i wish all of our congressmen would do the same !
im beginning to think rand paul &apos;s on drugs ....
people i totally dislike obamacare but you must remember a few things .
please don &apos;t turn your back on our children by confirming betsy devos .
get rid of irs !
correct scott .
hooyah lee
abolish the irs , replace it with something that is not so political .
no resources ?
that , my friends , is a spending problem , not a revenue problem .
how exactly did boehner get voted in to begin with , sir ?
i agree , but they probably won &apos;t stop doing obamas bidding !
well , at least he didn &apos;t rush his decision .
stop messing around and fix obamacare !
please don &apos;t support devos .
stand strong ... do not cave in ... no obamacare !
please sir , reconsider your position .
everything the federals govt does is better left to anyone but the federal govt .
stop the bs elise and think for yourself and forget party lines !
rand is trying not to be like mitt romney by appealing to the people .
this man has to be the most honest person in our government ! !
stand firm against o &apos;s unlawful action on imigration .
wow ppl think that obama is making change ?
for america to survive , we must cut all ties to muslim majority countries !

i already pay too much tax .
david , please tell lynn hello for me .
it is time to repeal the ndaa and patriot acts .
please get this to johnny !
sir , you know exactly what he meant .
foreign aide is killing this country .
mc cain is a disgrace to our country , to the gop .
the poor never receive the aid .
that he is actually going to follow the constitution .
rand paul , everything i see and hear about you impresses me !
hey jerry .
we will not give up the 2nd .
john mccain does not mean change at all .
stand up for us john , not for the traitor in chief !
impeach convict and deport ....
very disappointed in your vote for cloture on harry reid &apos;s gun control bill .
i accept out of wyoming emails .
the american people do not want obamacare !
so what if it hurts our credit rating .
have you said to cut all foriegn aid yet ? ? ? ? ?
no iran deal at all .
treaty with the un .
and jerry foster seems proud of you for that .

she doesn &apos;t represent me or the thousands fleeing kansas every year .
because he is a traitor
tell em &apos; , mia !
you voted on internet tax .
the best senator florida ever had !
get out , sir .
i stand with rand senator !
it will take deep spending cuts and modest tax increases to right the ship .
do not fail kansas kids !
trey gowdy doesn &apos;t think this way .
i am praying too !
it &apos;s people like marsha that do not .
yet you support someone who supports obamas amnisty plan !
good on you , sen. paul .
few months too late paul .
you do not represent the people of sc on this issue .
obamacare does enough of that .
we are praying you all !
thanks for the update , james .
go mia love .
please for everything that is good vote no ! ! !
flag isn &apos;t responsible for those deaths ! ! !
our senator john mccain held out for $ 50,600 !
boehner sucks and mcconnell is still on his knees kissing obama &apos;s feet .
reward our friends , punish our enemies .
tomorrow morning is judgement day to replace john boehner now or never !
was not happy with the debates
congressman poliquin is doing a terrific job .
please do not repeal without offering a better replacement .
2016 president rubio
he &apos;s behaving like a dictator .
please do whatever you need to do to defund this amnesty .
thanks so much senator paul .
no other country allows illegals to stay and then rewards them .
hope he found jesus .
just get rid of the obama care completely .
what part of our embargo with cuba has been a failure ?
perhaps getting illegals sent home would be a better move
i won &apos;t be voting for a single incumbent , paul ryan .
you make us proud mia .
love me some jimmy graham and saints football .
how come no one is doing anything about his unconstitutional illegal policies ?
my opinion has solidified around defunding npr completely .
i &apos;m very disappointed to hear your support of devos .
i hope this isn &apos;t too little too late !
the republicans should use your slogan , tom .
he ( obama ) is a disgrace !
thank god , a man with a spine
# endthefuckery # worstresponders # shame
impeach nikki haley !
mia you are doing a great job keep it going !
we need reagan strength .
let the people of south carolina decide this
well , congress needs to listen to the people and do what they want !
they should keep it up until every terrorist is found and eliminated .
doesn &apos;t seam like there &apos;s a stopping point for obama using his power .
our kids future under obama care will be more than they can carry
dear congressman coffman , greetings .
he has lost my vote !
it &apos;s outrageous , this administration is getting on my last nerve !
senator mccain , why are you supporting al-qaeda and its affiliates in syria ?
and &quot; no sort of aid from the government &quot; ?
he &apos;s an obama man - probably won &apos;t happen .
tehran tom .
go on fox and explain your vote on the un treaty .
senator perdue , you represent the citizens of georgia .
today it &apos;s the flag what is next !
there r provisions n the constitution that allows him that right .
may god be with you as you fight the good fight sir !
we really need congress to perform its constitutional duty of oversight .
mccain should go to prison for treason ! !
obama &apos;s wins if ron paul don &apos;t get on that ballet .
we do not need more liberal idiots attempting to run the country .
trey gowdy for president üëä
rino poser .
the government is buying them to keep them from us .
stop talking and start impeaching and prosecuting
i trust the troops will keep supporting you and the speaker !
impeach him for illegal actions !
then impeach the president .
balanced budget is only a small baby step .
thats your socialist pres .
senator mccain , it &apos;s more than that .
egypt is a clusterf * ck for this president .
read the constitution !
marco rubio , god bless you sir god bless you !
john mccain is an american terrorist .
&quot; how obamacare has harmed patients ... as a whole &quot; ?
flat tax where everybody pays !
i hope conservatives don &apos;t get screwed in conference .
happy thanksgiving , trey goudy !
continue to fight dr. the support is here !
he has no plan .
if we can &apos;t win back the once great republican party .
my mom and i saw you on hannity and thought you were fantastic .
someone who actually is going to do something anything for we the people !
no we do not believe it is good ! ! !
thanke trey gowdy
please do not send our troops over !
the house needs to come together and remove john boehner .
no foreign aid to any countries because that money is needed right here .
you are the govt , we elected you , do something
there needs to be additional border patrol officers at the borders
our conservative representatives should refuse to be a part of this ! !
get real and get honest , we need massive cuts to government spending
you are a sucker too , tom .
i know that chambliss is not .
you are a warrior of liberty !
the lies that are being told by this administration are astounding .
thank goodness because that bill would have further destroyed our military !
support cruz , mc shame ! ! ! !
prove you aren &apos;t spineless like the majority !
congress should investigate that and eric holder with a special prosecutor .
semper fi , sir .
stop with the amnesty .
thanks rep. blaine luetkemeyer !
our president has laid off more military than anyone ever before ....
you are not alone sir !
they could have saved our country !
i like rand and back him 100 % , but &quot; win &quot; ?
everything is less intrusive without the feds in charge .
all the more reason to impeach him .
absolutely correct !
time to move on marco .
so you are planning to repeal with no suitable replacement .
a constitutional convention - this is a good way to do that .
delete your account and resign
if he is a conggressmen he should be impeached .
i know some will respond that tax increases are the answer .
this was nothing more than a power grab by rinos .
i don &apos;t understand this stem act rand .
write in cruz .
as far as rinos go ?
secure the borders and stop amnesty !
‚Äî thomas jefferson , 3rd u.s. president and drafter of the declaration of independence .
this country is broke !
how about getting the 2 billion obama just gave them back ! ?
when are we going to impeash and imprison obama for treason .
trey is the best choice in my eyes ..
major kudos mr. mccain and mr. graham .
you and the rest of the rino &apos;s are the deplorables .
i &apos;m starting to think you are not mentally balanced
so when are you going to start impeachment proceedings .
i am out of state here and i want to help rand paul win .
shame on you fred .
7 years late , but better late than never .. close gitmo !
i think tim is a very nice well spoken man .
rand is refreshing !
harry reid gone would help .
is jerry taking credit for something he didn &apos;t have anything to do with ?
sure but don &apos;t let obama off for treason in benghazi
have a great day , james and be safe !
obamacare needs to be defunded and our boarders secured !
senator mccain , need you to save our country .
that he will close down the internet and go play golf .
yay , bruce !
i supported you i pray you will be a conservative .
have you done anything to move the immigration issue forward , toward a solution ?
to afford spending , we need much higher taxes .
protect our money rand .
never thought i &apos;d say this but i agree with rubio .
it is obvious that our enemies are becoming more numerous every day !
republicans continue to cave .
obama speaks nothing but lies !
mr. obama is a politician , nothing else .
war is a lie , sir .
abolish the dea , replace it with absolutely nothing .
here &apos;s to standing with integrity and standing with rand paul .
pointing out that mccain is a loathsome human being doesnt dishonor anyone else .
you &apos;re violating the constitution and committing treason .
greg , we know you are lying .
not even marco rubio ! !
i &apos;m letting ted nuget take my place
you are trying to get a lot of aerospace jobs to move to oklahoma .
please run against lindsey graham .
now defund obamacare
well rand stupid is ( mccain ) as stupid does ( graham ) .
stop paying the irs
no one stopped him ...
mia , you &apos;re going to make it this time .
: you , mcmillan and mccain meeting with al-bahgdadi , isis leader .
obama needs some &quot; bumps &quot; on his little noggin head ... !
we wanted boehner voted out of his speakership .
keep on keepin on mia love .
we know that obamacare is killing jobs all across the country .
the congress couldn &apos;t do their job .. now it &apos;s obama &apos;s fault .
he is doing exactly what he wants and getting away with it .
congressman lamborn please find away to get the u.s. on track to energy independence .
you said you would support the nominee no matter who it was .
we don &apos;t trust obama .
the sierra club is a conservative organization .
and a merry christmas to you and your family mr gowdy god bless
go campaign for your rino buddy .
which republican will stop this tyrant ?
option b yes !
trey gowdy america loves you you make us proud merry christmas üéÑ üéÅ üá∫ üá∏
when will any details of the possible replace be shared with the american people ?
they have no love .
nothing can stop what we are forced to endure now .
this country has a spending problem and a giveaway problem .
we support you , marco !
fred is taking his 11 % approval rating for a spin here .
the government is sucking the life out of us second class tax payers .
sasse is a tool .
inhofe and coburn need to be voted out .
you can &apos;t disgrace the smug s o b
jerry what &apos;s congress doing about the fast and furious fiasco ?
have to balance the budget without the use of tax increases .
undoubtedly the most princabled politician out there a true patriot
cut spending and cut revenue .
read the news reports not fox
kim allen south carolina .
betsy devos is simply not qualified to lead our public schools .
the citizens who pay your salary desire a unified republican party .
yeah , vern .
whoever the rebublican nominee is , they will get my vote .
overwhelming they say &quot; no &quot; to betsy devos .
as far away from thom thillis as possible , please .
just go ahead and try to impeach the president .
hello bob can you hear us now ?
please vote no on devos , we all know she is unqualified .
it has to been done with a blend of all three rep. scott .
good for you sam .
your the man rand paul
finally ...... paul ryan , you did the right thing .
( you lying rino scumbag ) .
so true it makes you sad to see us going down this
remember we are just days away from the return of jesus christ .
you should have been this forceful months ago .
i think you have that wrong , mr. mcclintock .
please .... please .... reject the nomination of betsy devos for the dept .
run marco and make a difference .
fbi director comey &apos;s team took just 9 days to clear through 650,000 emails .
he is so much like ronald reagan .
every union in america is against the conservative agenda .
he owes it to the american people .
as a product of public education , i do not support devos .
mccain has trumps taxes and he has tapes of trump talking to putin .
i will no longer visit sc because of your little whiny attitude .
even if they have proof of innocence they wont file nothing !
mia love for veep ! ! ! !
i do not have insurance , and still don &apos;t agree with obamacare .
no obamacare don &apos;t fund it .
i &apos;m praying that you start listening to the people .
you or devos .
that is what rand paul filibustered for , the rights of american citizens .
where &apos;s the referral from trey gowdy to the fbi for purjery ?
come on conservatives are supposed to vote in favor of the birther bill .
mia america hates what washington has become .
you &apos;re one of the 2 republicans that didn &apos;t vote for devos .
just one more spineless punk republicrat rino .
oooppss some one better tell barry
we want them out of washington and out of out government immediately .
actually you can have both you can be free and secure in jesus !
why does v c
congratulations senator mcconnell .
i don &apos;t pray for tyrants !
check out liberty first pac .
politicians like you are why north carolina has plummeted in public education .
i saw where tim scott is donating his to charity .
the epa is out of control !
the patriot act needs to die .
senator : it is time you support the presumptive republican nominee donald trump .
rinos are part of the democratic party aka the establishment .
so much for the us being a &quot; christian &quot; nation !
bush was a small problem , obama is a huge one ! !
the threat the house used to repeal was to shut down obamacare was ignored .
impeach obama--he is a traitor .
fir a lot less , nixon was and there were no deaths .
until this is realized , the republican party is stuck in the same boat .
no cell phones for any welfare
john boehner has led the party of no .
how can i send senator mccain a message ?
obama needs to get a grip and open his eyes .
veterans don &apos;t even like mccain .
why didn &apos;t you answer luke rudkowski when he asked you a simple question !
thank god for the leadership trey gowdy provides !
a reading of the constitution is great .
just a little too late , dont ya think ? ?
mitch mcconnell is a disgrace .
once he gets us disarmed , there will be nothing to stop him .
please , you and senator graham must take action .
regards , c .
no refund ?
only the good ol boys and girls are left to defend america
vote to impeach the traitor / imposter currently residing in our white house .
this administration is not the answer .
never liked fox news
republicans need to stand up to the president and not be bullied ! !
pray for dr. carson !
-sean hannity
mr rubio is a great leader , as is mr romney .
i love ted cruz and his ability to tell it like it is .
mccain is an embarrassment .
he says it is a common practice .
hang in there senator rand , america needs you .
time for the government to put term limits on the house and senate .
we need to stick to our principles and hold the line .
vote no on cloture - vote no on cloture = vote no on cloture !
we need people like you ... rand paul for president 2016
when is obama going to be impeached ? ? ? ?
we don &apos;t have a spending problem !
this flag had nothing to do with the shootings .
you have nothing to replace it with .
go get em bruce !
something like that greg .
i know that congress will never impeach him .
we have to stop him before his cronies disband the congress and senate .
just keep thinking that way mia .
praying doesnt stop these terrorist attacks
never give up the fight , congressman ted yoho .
lindsey much prayer is going for israel ... god help us all ...
your supposed to be working for the american people not self-serving and for illegals !
i expected you represent the people of north carolina in the way you voted .
the republican party has been just as elusive to truth as the democrats .
the republican party should have gotten behind kasich .
so stop blaming obama for things that he did not cause .
fred miller
lying established republican government establishment .
bring jobs for what is taken like food stamps , ect .
no one believes a word you say paul ! !
not going to get this from our current admin .
please stand firm in congress to stand this mistake down .
i &apos;ve been in favor of the flat tax for many years
hoping congress can change this veto
so been a partisan , be a patriot !
congress needs to uphold the constitution and the laws that are already written .
cut taxes !
no .. he should be impeached and tried for treason ! !
you have not stopped obama from anything and we will be defeated from within .
you are so right tom mcclintock
outstanding tom .
rubio too !
rand paul i hope you do not turn on the american people .
bush , mccain , and romney are not conservatives either .
none , absolutely none will get my vote next time !
betsy devos will not be a qualified secretary of education .
aca-obamacare can be defunded without senate approval .
yes and bring up his record with benghazi .
and ted cruz reading dr. seuss was not a publicity stunt ? ? ?
how about you stand up and have a spine once all you spineless republicans .
he will veto everything just for spite .
is bob goodlatte sitting on a pile of impeachment bills like harry reid did ?
the government is doing something ?
lincoln was a self serving politician who trampled the constitution .
the govt should stay out of it .
honestly sir , have you no sense of shame ?
obama is worse then carter , truman , and johnson combined .
america &apos;s children deserve much better than devos .
all the liberals want to do is tax tax tax ....
i love it that the republican party is being put in their place .
had you unified republican support months ago it wouldn &apos;t be this bad .
ok rand .
it is pitiful that pelosy &amp; reid have already said the bill is doa .
and reagan did ?
marco educate yourself and speak truthfully .
he is a straight up constitutionalist / small government man .
but going by this attack on rubio i believe you do not .
obama doesn &apos;t care about anyone except low info voters , illegals .
stand ur ground and stay on trac ! ! ! !
stand your ground col. better yet , stand fast our constitution .
you think no amount is too much for military spending .
i hope the gop will stand firm on this issue .
a 3rd party run will accomplish nothing .
betsy devos is grossly unqualified .
ole paul is eating some crow
@ dennis clearly you don &apos;t know mr tom mcclintock !
yes lets make it a great year , dump the rino .
any way we can talk rep. trey gowdy into running for senate ?
but they are refusing to do what the constitution demands they do !
shame on you , mitch mcconnell !
we need to cut spending !
rand , never compromise !
you sir are a disgrace to south carolina .
obama offered the repubs to come up with something better .
obama has been out to destroy this country since day one .
you guys govern like you have been bought out .
the american people should never be forced to purchase something .
god &apos;s wrath will hunt obama and h.clinton down
he needs to do time .
living by principle is more important than going with the flow .
sorry , sherrie , i will be on vacation in florida .
our constitution means nothing to you !
we have a law that says our borders are to be sealed .
why i &apos;am starting to listen to rand .
please do not let him do this mr. paul ?
this constituent asks you to vote no on devos .
rand paul .. you are a hero among politicians nowadays .
megan megan lynn that is poetry evil if you to say .
yes , impeach him already .
much less the rest of the constitution .
a fine man &amp; republican !
time for you to go lindsey .
he asked to many questions .
bush tax cuts .
everyone should have to take obamacare .
obamacare should have never gotten far .
god bless you , your family , and the fire rescue and hospital staff .
so right mia
we want our freedom back
if there ever was a time to stand for the constitution it &apos;s now .
you are just saying what you think republican voters want to hear .
senator marco rubio
what took you so long to see this truth paul ryan ?
good work senator paul .
gaylan , not only the democrats , but the rinos also .
the president didn &apos;t shut anything down .
praying for all of our leaders , in jesus name , amen .
keep up the good work mr. congressman and you still have my vote !
big business wins again thanks to pawns like congressman vern buchanan .
why have you guys not vote on an immigration bill ?
i know i &apos;m voting for rand paul .
ya a rubio se le olvido el espa√±ol .
impeach that dictator , put him up on trial for treason !
hope things work out for you mike , you got my vote .
she has no experience with public schools .
thanks dictator obama for making my life he &apos;ll .
he will veto everything and the country will stagnate .
he was way beyond a socialist dictator .
yes , prayers for them also .
gowdy for president !
mia , i think fox news made a mess of things .
electing a real conservative speaker .
they go up when people do not pay their dang doctor bill .
defund obamacare and protect retirement programs .
what obama is doing will cause terrorist to occupy our country for decades !
agree with mr andrews ... we want gvt out of our healthcare
you rock , johnny !
god bless you &amp; praying for morality to come back to america
mccain is a tool .
and i don &apos;t live in sc .
but , a bad one would give dc even more power .
they &apos;ll villinize their enemies and then final step is to institute genocide .
dave - where is the tea party or republican budget ?
i would like to see you do a video blog sir .
no sir , do something about it !
blake is right .
they should be calling you paul 2016 .
whatever john mccain
i think you can kiss future potus goodbye now .
kerry , obama and that crew cannot be trusted .
the tsa was active when the &quot; under wear bomber &quot; made his attempt .
dear scott , the law passed .
paul ryan loser ...... should have never questioned anything
you &apos;re full of it , john thune .
you are not doing the job we sent you to d.c. to do .
like the republican revolution !
he has now helped our enemies know how we can monitored them .
i have never been so afraid for our liberties &amp; constitution rights .
he hasn &apos;t helped the us since he has been office .
yes removing that flag is really going to stop this .
anyone who voted for obamacare is a communist !
a majority of americans want the affordable care act yet don &apos;t want obamacare .
trading with the enemy act the government closed them down .
do something , sue , impeachment , try him for treason .
no conservative will win if trump becomes president .
you &apos;d be much better than rino barasso .
obama should be impeached ! ! !
devos is so obviously unqualified for this important position .
then mr bozeman voted to fund the bill .
don &apos;t think it is paul ryan .
all you do is talk in circles and get nothing done .
no thanks ! ! ! !
i pray that removing the flag will make a difference !
that is grounds for federal charges isn &apos;t it ?
please keep up the good work , marsha .
washington needs to learn that lesson .
our marsha has been on the side of the angels on this issue .
happy easter trey gowdy
otherwise , why would you complain about the potus doing your job ?
obama needs to be prosecuted for the illegal wars .
that means if you vote establishment you get no change .
be careful rand , he &apos;s the guy reagan warned us about .
carry on mr. paul , as you were .
why aren &apos;t you at your town hall meeting ?
all should have to suffer from the same malady called obamacare , no exclusions !
listen to your constituents , because he &amp; his staff certainly are not .
then arrest him and impeach him while he is imprisoned .
sooo , rand paul , i am scratching you off my list !
stay on track , sir .
unfortunately , obama will disregard congress , as usual .
excellent speech today , senator paul ! !
we hear you rand !
most republications are very upset with you on this amnesty thing !
rep. gosar was at a town hall monday .
lets not forgat to abolish the irs
such wasteful government spending .
right on mia love ! ! ! ! !
sound like you will be able to go to cuba soon !
if obama doesn &apos;t follow the law again have him removed from office !
chris christie is losing weight starting with his brain .
the only clear action in this issue is to secure our border first .
you will go down in history as a 1 term traitor
you mr. isakson chickned out too &amp; you need to be recalled !
this amnesty was passed before with reagan and failed .
don &apos;t forget obozo obummer &amp; killary in that list .
i stand with rand , but asking $ 250 or more is outrageous !
they should all be fired .... right after the irs is abolished !
john mccain once again exhibits incredible wisdom .
not so when it comes to devos .
the beltway and the establishment think that we are stupid ! ! !
obama doesn &apos;t respect you &apos;ll and intends to do what ever he wants .
marco rubio i am voting for you because of your love for america !
glad you did senater billy graham
you and mccain are cowards .
amen now comes florida ! ! ! !
first one being repeal of obamacare !
it &apos;s way too late for prayers .
cant wait , go gettem mr , harper
i do not trust obummer or the ayatollah in iran .
lead the charge , marco .
you have nothing to replace it with before you voted to repeal it ?
use him to guide our nation back to you , o lord .
why hasn &apos;t impeachment started on obama &amp; all those who are with him ?
cut spending , please .
government spending is the problem , sorry to tell you that includes government contractors .
oh that good ole small government republican mindset !
god bless you , senator sasse .
you had you chance flake , but you screwed it up .

polished speaker or not truth is truth and all media is distraction anyways !
with said , mr. mccain .
let them own obamacare lock stock and failure .
tell them to have the testicular fortitude to vote against amnesty .
no matter what we need to stick to our conservative beliefs .
hope you enjoy the little time you have left !
have to agree with johnny on this
properly vetting anyone he nominates is likewise a constitutional obligation of the senate .
reagan he had the guts to face the russians
no law , no legislation will fix it .
senator paul , i had all but given up on the u.s. government .
what kind of trade goods does cuba have that america would ever want ?
when did obama get his u.s. citizenship back after he became an indonesian citizen ?

do you ever watch c span or cnn david ?
either way , you are making a big mistake and you need to reconsider .
may god give you and your family the best year ever in 2016 !
start impeaching the current so-called president ! !
the pres is going to play his own game to his own rules .
stand on your principles because they represent ours .
unqualified
obamacare is a prime example of how he dictates and does not lead .
congressman jim bridenstine wrote : &quot; this isn &apos;t just a problem with obamacare .
we do not support devos .
no amnesty , the economy .
can &apos;t the people on the hill see what obama is doing to america ?
57 % of the american people have spoken , we don &apos;t want obamacare .
no path to citizenship for anyone or their decendents who came here illegally- period !
we need to impeach the s.o.b.
my rinos sold me out .
sorry you were treated like a common criminal in nashville , tn .
hopefully , you will reconsider your position and vote no to cloture .
wonder if it is such a &quot; big business &quot; in a socialized system .
ditto tim and diane .
why no impeachment yet ?
if you are for illegal amnesty you will lose .
he &apos;s the president he should be bringing parties together not further apart .
tell it like it is tim .
stop playing games , your making our republican forefathers turn in their graves .
congress needs to be able to make and enforce the laws .
i like rand paul ( his dad too )
it &apos;s not about healthcare it &apos;s about the communist trojan horse that is obamacare
we need honest men like you in the republican party .
stop them , marsha !
lindsey , wtf were you thinking ?
- devos has no practical experience in education .
holder should be hung from a tall tree
please how can we conservatives stop this corrupt congress we have today ? ?
can &apos;t defeat lawlessness with the law .
i don &apos;t know what mike lee ever did to him !
we need to pass a law eliminating executive orders .
i pray that your employers send you home .
well something different he finally stopped blaming george bush !
defund obamacare or lose you seat !
yes , obama , senator graham has more questions and we demand truthful answers .
betsey devos is vastly unqualified .
senator mccain , you listed no az pork .
why hasn &apos;t the repulican elected officials done absolutely nothing since getting elected ?
let the govt stay shut down .
appreciate your comment , praying is the only answer to our problems .
no raise in gas tax and you may be on the right track ...
you are absolutely worthless .
what would usa do without you mr. gowdy ?
i pray gods will be done
congressman yoho will fight for what &apos;s right .
sen. paul &apos;s august 28 statement pretty much reflects my view on the situation .
the federal government should keep their incompetent hands off the internet !
something inside you trey is so refreshing and hope giving .
congrats from georgia .
did i say any would moran .
very disappointed in paul ryan and rubio
being here illegal is breaking the law .
the senators in va listen to no one but barry
there should be no debate .
quit talking and get the impeachment started !
tom richardson : obamacare leaves 30 million uninsured .
you should have been a real republican and supported trump .
a rarity in washington d.c.
why couldn &apos;t gowdy have had enough courage to say that today ! !
best wishes dr. paul
rand paul , stop obama .
good job tim scott
yes , the unconstitutional executive order and that needs to stop at all cost !
well put trey ! !
dear senator tillis , great you are praying .
merry christmas to you and yours senator paul
mr lankford - please hold fast .
no more politicians mr rubio .
get your butt in washington and try something new and halt his agenda
robert , please remain civil .
my personal answer no !
he wants nothing better than to destroy this country
run with it mia i &apos;m with you !
how about across the board tax cuts ?
non-support for the republican nominee is support for the dems .
kagan &apos;s long-term associations with socialist and communist groups are mind-boggling .
oh wait obama is in control we are all screwed .
their sole intent seems to be smearing sen graham .
delay obamacare .
and crist is sorry just like the noles
leave obamacare to the side for now if that &apos;s what it takes .
why , tom ?
and bad for our freedom and liberty and country in general .
holder needs some federal penitentiary time .
can we impeach this communist ?
diane i csnt believe you still think the house shut down the country .
no new taxes we don &apos;t need an internet tax .
in other words he knows it is the lord who direct a mans steps .
to proclaim that all conservative protests are peaceful , however , is untrue .
how do you stand with obamacare ?
we are paying for ss , so how about cutting wasteful military spending .
i would like to see some action on immediate concerns for oklahoma .
i cant stand him
welcome to republican party , party 1st , lobbyist 2nd .. america 3rd .
stick another criminal act against obama and his crew .
at least congressman gibson was a thoughtful conservative .

thanks rand ... you &apos;ve got a lot of people backing you !
thanks , ted .
john mccain speaks : the world listens .

this is what happens when you take impeachment off the table
when is my next town hall joe ?
this time the republicans have attached planned parenthood to the repeal .
we need to stand with our true friends israel
praying for a miracle .... he is able .
why do you blame republicans for everything ? the pres .
he is a muslim and will set his people free !
the south will rise again !
we need more rand pauls in washington to stand up for us .
two words : rand paul

trey gowdy is a true american .

the voice of liberty and freedom cannot be stifled .
flat tax is easy on w-2 income .
one of the many reasons i voted for you marco rubio , well said .
hang in there mia this country needs you .
yes , the government needs to pay them back
just following in the feds footsteps .
rand paul detained by tsa for refusing screening as too invasive .
senator , thanks for your efforts thus far to defund obamacare .
the large majority of the american people say no .
quit whining and do your job .
put god back in this country and see the amazing things he can do .
we need the president &amp; hillary held accountable for benghazi
this is the stuff of king george and we all ought to be furious .
because he &apos;s in obama &apos;s pocket .
it is time to clean house of all career politicians .
why wont they impeach him they have more than anough reason
obama is a liberals liberal .
the tax code should fit on 3x5 note card .
try not sucking on romneys butt too much rand .
all these conservatives and not one brain .
keep standing on christ the solid rock james
it is no wonder that the american public is fed up with congress .
please reverse your opinion on betsy devos .
no sir he has not .
need to audit the fed !
probably none !
a republican pulling an obama
you should be more interested in sustainable , renewable energy jobs here in georgia .
he is a documented liar and a president with almost no accomplishments .
i like blaine but if this is true he lost my vote .
good , maybe the senate will do something with the tsa
steve , i may have missed anything you wrote about obamacare .
lastly , mrs. devos is simply unqualified for this position .
i &apos;d reconsider this response if i were in your position .
this is not obama &apos;s debt , and you know that .
mr. mccain , i really think you need to choose sides .
a president who supports our constitution .
residual effects of obamacare .
then the deal with terrorist iran .
there is so much more to do besides concentrating on obamacare .
how about , dismantle the irs completely and go with a fair flat tax ....
obama and the obama administration
big debt + bad dollar = no job growth .
keep hammering them , lou !
very true tom !
too bad prince harry stonewall reid will let it die !
bruce is helping veterans !
no obama care legalize marijuana ! ! !

you are fighting the good fight , mike .
gotta love rand paul !
crashing the u.s. health care system was the original intent / agenda , tom .
no need to answer that , rand !
no politics involved .
check out the snarky , libertarian version of the life of julia !
from the &quot; expert &quot; himself regarding the fox interview .
override the veto next .
god bless you little guy
margaret thatcher was a great conservative and a fantastic lady .
obama fully understands that but that is not consistent with his socialist agenda .
i applaud obama for doing something to take care of god &apos;s earth !
please share wi all your republican and conservative counterparts up there martha .
time for congress to act before it is to late .
i could care less if congress has to sign up for obamacare .
impeachment would be a more effective approach .
congressman buchanan , you will have more information than we will .
praying for wisdom and truth to be revealed in this leadership .
cruz and lee are demonstrating real guts and leadership .
all over the world christians have hope and pray long live america .
this is a key vote for your heritage action conservative score .
i am not a liberal or conservative .
sure wish you were republican presidential nominee .
usa can survive default but we cannot survive o-care .
i second that from az go mia go .
&gt; &gt; robert hayes &quot; the survey in nc says .
they do what their told to do , by the &quot; emperor obama &quot;
due to her part in the irs scandal .
rand paul supports fairtax.org
if marco rubio would have run with romney we would have won hands down .
go help rand paul who is filibustering brennan over the drones .
everyone needs to stand with cruz to try to defund it .
treason is punishable by impeachment and jail .
bush jr and obama took the stance that americans elected me and thats that .
i oppose devos , and i &apos;m a republican !
i &apos;m ashamed of mo brooks everybody else that voted for boehner .

prayer is part of the problem in this nation .
listening to the irs hearings !
great job johnny and bob !
impeach the whole crowd needs to go ! !
big of you ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
impeachment proceedings must be brought against this president and his extremely inept administration .
i agree james robertson

your right marco
in ky never or tom
keep fighting , sir !
no you need to get obama out of office
we would not have the freedoms we have today , without our soldiers !

at least you &apos;re not out spending our money on golf games .
thanks mike for all you have done for us
god bless this country , and you mr .
he &apos;ll veto .
sc will truly miss him ! ! ! ! !
this election is not a vote for republicans mr. ryan !
he has an agenda not his own !
so it would be inconvenient if you don &apos;t do what potus says ?
he wants us completely dependent on government .
this president needs to go ! ! ! !
we must cut spending !
please sir get obamacare defunded and please start the procedure for impeachment of obama
yes , obama &apos;s overreach is that serious .
merry christmas to you and yours , dr. c

i thought i voted for you to stop the spending , mr. walberg .
my congressman , luke messer disappointed many of us today ... you did not .
john mccain is a patriot , he served his country with honor .

i &apos;m all for religious freedom !
screw them rand , you stood up , more than most !
i wish that your dad had been the nominee , rand .
liberty is liberty .
i will never forget your vote to repeal dadt .
mccain warned us abot fannie mae and freddy mac ten years ago !
about time mccain sounded republican
then do not move from iowa to tennessee like i did .
the epa has a tendency to create conflicting regulations and cannot agree with itself .
we cant win with a third party .
vote no tim !
exactly why the next potus must be a conservative !
bush you are the next looser
no , and we should not have sent $ 1.7 billion to iran .
give em hell tim !
no tax , no way , no how ! !
i &apos;d vote to remove all of his executive power .
it should be rare that legislation be greater in length than the constitution !
how about giving our funds back to local school districts and abolishing common core .
um , obummer is supposed to execute the law .
christie likes to change positions on whatever suits what he needs .
loved carly &amp; ted cruz
no he did not .
i oppose betsy devos and i vote .
people are beginning to realize this guy is no leader .
you are slowly chipping away at our constitutional rights .
and no one in the congress is doing anything about it .
mlk would be treated like herman cain in the lamestream media ..
kudos to ran paul last night !
he sunk his ship months ago , and # evanmcmullin is the lifeboat .
the president has bent over backwards to get anything done with congress .
boehner was no conservative , not sure if any are left in congress ?
mr. gowdy , do you have intentions of running for the big chair ?
had enough of you and graham both .
he has risen just as he said !
praying for him and his family .
why weren &apos;t the people of south carolina to vote on it ?
mr. fred upton , what do you propose ?
benjamin franklin , george washington &amp; abe lincoln
including our constitutional rights .
let them send the dogs you have many friends in liberty .
save us , john mccain , you &apos;re the only one who can .
it is my opinion that the house is the only way to stop him .
why haven &apos;t impeachment proceedings begun ?
don &apos;t worry about speaker ryan .
government has failed the american people !
first principles first !
mccain for president 2012 ! ! ! !
the house has sole control of the purse strings .
we need more people like john mccain to press through .
merry christmas mr gowdy and family
god bless you for looking out for true americans .
i was hoping trey gowdy was going to get scj
i am a sc teacher with over 20 years experience .

harford gillaspie congress wants border security .
we deserve the government we vote for .
freedom and small government .
impeach dt ! !
bashing rand paul for his filibuster ?
you had no obligation to offer an alternative to obamacare .
and what will you and the rino types do about it ?
i sent my aarp card back when aarp endorsed obamacare .
there is no way we can trust anyone or anything at this point .
remember , most gitmo detainees haven &apos;t been charged with a crime yet ..
sir wont you please run for president ?
üôè üôè üéÑ merry christmas &amp; may god bless you &amp; yours !
what a mistake vote was , and he got it .
wonderful , mr ryan but where were you earlier ?
obamacare is only part of the problem .
including mr. ryan here .
she will not be good for the country or the state of georgia .
obama is not in charge of spending .
cruz is a member of the establishment !
we need you as vp marco please help us win
also corker and alexander need to go .
based on that pic he needs it .
another redneck out south carolina
anyway it is a done deal .
good choice on carolina !
sp glad you were so wrong , lindsey .

we are with you sir to the very end
obama is the worst president this country has ever had
our founding fathers got it right .
if he by passes congress that is illegal and he should be impeached .
paul ryan never heard of her .
obama stinks .
so mr. gowdy who will be prosecuted ?
good riddance to that spineless pos
have ya &apos;ll decided how long you are gonna wait before you cave ?
it doesn &apos;t make sense that they would curtail our freedoms .
president paul , really not going to happen .
we have to kill obamacare before it kills us .
mr enzi joins trump in the wholesale selling of america .
oh yes , the laws are for us .. barry is above the law ...
how about getting impeachment proceedings in motion !
vickie lynn cole-hendrix
i want to be one of the first to apologize to congressman poe .
our national debt increased 89 % under this president george w. bush .
we also want communist comey locked up
time to hit the unlike button , see ya lefty lindsey .
john mccain is passing out lollipops and some whoop @ ss .
mccain for president ! !
we americans need to wake up before our constitution is trampled beyond repair .
yhes , but not at the expense of free law abiding people &apos;s liberty .
happy anniversary , johnny &amp; dianne !
balance the budget ... stop the spending and stop this nonsense .
when you do not have the money you stop spending !
keep on track senator tim scott
btw , pass a clean budget bill !
we have an obama problem
i agree with tom m
our president is not capable !
we need spending cuts that is the problem folks not taxes .
people who i know like their obamacare .
now i know he &apos;s not a true republican !
she has little to no experience in the field of education .
typical lying from the left to waste more of our tax dollars .
obamacare is good , just needs tweaking .
my senator from kentucky voted against it .
happy thanksgiving and god bless you senator paul .
traitor barry soetoro deserves no respect sir !
no pre existing on insurance coverage .
what about defunding batfe ?
stand strong , stand faithful brother .
the people of georgia pay for the playing of politics , johnny .
we need a change , but not the one obama is imposing !
you should stand up for us on the defunding of obamacare !
i hope to listen to the rebuttal by senator rubio .
the confederate flag had nothing to do with this crime .
i would suggest cutting our military budget , especially nato .
these bunch of spineless rinos wouldn &apos;t dare do that .
do the job , brother .
save us john mccain
thanks .... now can you talk to lindsy graham for me .
another example of the feds looking out for themselves .....
you are whatwrong with the republican party .
clearly the administration is either incompetent or malicious- either of which is completely unacceptable .
our government needs to learn to operate like a business and be efficient ! 1
paul ryan , you are a snake .
devos is woefully unqualified for the position .
praying for comfort &amp; peace to the marines families .
i guess that only applies when we want prayer in schools .
i would repeal healthcare for sure !
our president is not listening to the american people .

happy thanksgiving to everyone and please remember our troops in your prayers

he is doing exactly what obama wants , destroying the usa .
too bad for the republican party

stay strong jerry , we back you 100 % .
is obama our president or not ?
no raise on the debt ceiling .

... obama is out of control with his overwhelming use of executive orders !
gotta have a pres who will veto any spending !
obama get your head out of the clouds and help american people
actually it was not a tax increase .
crist is an obama hugger and will be kissing his ?
show these spineless drones how it &apos;s done .
stay true trey , and may god bless your pursuits .

i have a suggestion for your next town hall meeting .. lose the charts ..
who is the &quot; we &quot; who are spending the money ?
may god continue to bless your family !
then drilll baby drill
stand strong against this charlatan , mia !
how long was it before obama went to iraq or afghan .
there is no reason for our military to aid syria , none !
obummer wants us to keep buying oil from his arab friends .
obama wants us weak , so he can do more damages .
when has he ever done what he must ? ?
a real man owns his issues just like marco did on this statement .
please work to impeach trump .
delete what it costs tsa from what we give away every year .
they all need impeachment for failing to do their jobs !
yes gowdy for commander in chief ! ! ! !
rubio did well .
3 billion dollar earmark for mitch mcconnell &apos;s backwater dam project .
government produces / creates absolutely nothing - it can only take and redistribute .
thanks congressman bob goodlatte
gods blessing to amanda &amp; family
as if the republicans don &apos;t tax and spend for needless wars ?
why does he want them to pass a bill when he does this ?
# worstresponders - your actions are reprehensible .
thought her speech was elegant and very complimentary to speaker boehner .
mr gowdy , please stop this man .
let the democrats grant amnesty to millions of left-voting illegal immigrants .
a man who believes in the constitution
go tom , go ! !
she will be confirmed because we have too many spineless people in washington ! !
perfectly stated , mia .
tim , i really wish you would run for president !
well we &apos;re waiting johnny

i &apos;m liking what i hear , marco !
thanks to bruce poliquin for the va letter he sent to me .

he sure did listen to the constituents ... didn &apos;t he ! ?
praying you can get your work done , this nation &apos;s work .
you voted for obama care so i get to not vote for you
you are wrong , isakson .
marco you will be the next presidential canidate .
ryan , grover norquist opposes my position on taxes and subsidies .
please , senator scott , do what is right !
you will be held accountable for dismantling the aca without a replacement plan .
i pray the truth comes out
wait until obama &apos;s gone first .
please mia make the party hold up up what we voted for ! !
right on senator paul
i am a conservative and this tactic make me sick to my stomach .
y &apos;all job is to look after use .
so very disheartened listening to your town hall meeting .
i haven &apos;t lost faith in bruce .
better question is what are you gonna do about it ?
representative mcclintock , please add your support to ending animal abuse by cosponsoring h.r.
i think no truth comes out of dc they just cant do it !
maybe az will vote against mccain and you two lovers can disappear together .
also , wish you wouldn &apos;t have voted for boehner .
johm mccain
i agree that no president is above the law ! !
no compromise , defund aca .
its our constitutional right you arrogant pinhead !
so very disappointed on your vote that further kills america with more debt .
the other candidates saw ron paul and now try to imitate him .
he supported the republican party when he could have ran independent !
they will likely do this in the december cr .
personally i like and admire sam .
somebody call 911--- sasse run over by the trump train ! !
hey morg , keep up the good work .. our nation needs you !
obviously he did not or he would be impeached or in prison .
no big surprise here !
will you filibuster with rand , cruz &amp; lee ?
sending prayers for all ....
doug definitely does his liberal homework .
still with you , marco !
a very happy thanksgiving to you mr. gowdy
sorry for your loss , paul .
before reagan there was actually upward mobility in this country .
educate your children on our constitution
mm , you are a gutless , spineless rino .
well deserved lee
we now have capitalism in china and socialism in washington .
but if not , just wear your rino badge with pride .
in a representative republic you vote for your constituents , not your party .
rand keep taken the fight to them ! ! !
keep up the good weork marsha !
really mr. yoho , let &apos;s see the facts .
don &apos;t want to pay that dumb tax for not buying the junk !
also a repudiation of failed rino policies .
do what is congress going to do about it ?
marco rubio lied to gop voters for taking the pledge .
do the right thing vote no on cloture !
too bad our commander in chief is too busy to meet with pm netanyahu .
very true its a wild fire out of control
pollspoll : should barrack obama be impeached for releasing terrorists from gitmo ?
rand paul must be insane !
it is a shameful practice for the industry &amp; for tennessee .
no thanks to your support .
&quot; nay &quot; to devos .
real americans god loving humble americans is what makes this country great ! !
read his conversion from liberal to conservative .
i hear that congress is trying to exempt themselves from obamacare .
and you and mr. mccain are an embarrassment to this state .
voters will toss out most of them i pray .
only sell arms to true allies .
ooo-rah sir !
thankful for ben carson and chris christie and the few who supported trump .
signed , 1975 graduate of wyoming public schools
i &apos;m glad obama is doing what he &apos;s doing .
senator enzi , i am disappointed and ashamed by your vote .
obama is vile .
shame on you , mitch mcconnell ! !
devos is the wrong person for the job .
you have my prayers !
i see all the liberals ( 1960 &apos;s holdovers or wannabes ) are well indoctrinated
i was a supporter of yours marco .
is senator marco rubio about to cave on our second amendment rights ?
hope it &apos;s not to little , to late .
we would have to increase taxes by 40 % to cover our spending .
lets just eliminate the irs and put a reasonable flat tax on everybody .
people are starting to get wise and obama is throwing another tantrum .
congressmen fred upton and greg walden just introduced legislation to block net neutrality .
sen paul when is the senate going to call for obamas impeachment ?
why shouldn &apos;t the president appoint someone who will do what he wants done .
vern happy easter to sandy , the boys and you .
i will vote for you rand !
emperor obama !
rand paul is not one either .
tim and the rest of republicans .
and yet barry wants more !
join with rep. stockman from houston tx and impeach obama if he skirts congress !
you are a good man rand , dont not let them break your spirit
after impeachment then prosecution for treason and the deportation ... get it
to blame a flag for what someone did is stupid .
voting for a president is picking the lesser of 2 evils anymore .
time for massive recalls and an impeachment !
senator mccain , tired of trump asking for an apology .
death tax is absurd .... makes no sense
i voted for bruce and very proud to do so
diane needs to go .
help us tom !
paul ryan you are the poster boy for term limits
don &apos;t stop until this ridiculous administration gives in !
is it true that obama is shutting down the south defense system ?
flat tax no loop holes
his list of impeachable offenses gets longer and longer .
george washington , teddy roosevelt , ronald reagan
thank god someone in washington has the backbone to stand up to king hussein ...
maybe we should tax the church to fund planned parenthood .
tired of obamacare .
japan tried tax cuts .
supporting this agreement should be a &quot; no brainer &quot; .
obama isn &apos;t like lankford , who always thinks the glass is half empty .
happy thanksgiving lou and your family
no replacement until after the election !
good for you , senator ryan !
good luck marco !
sir you have lost my respect and my vote .
it &apos;s past time sir .
sorry for the cuts senator graham you just can &apos;t fix stupid .
praying since it happened last night .
obama is like a spoil brat , his way or no way .
mia , please consider endorsing dr. ben carson for president .
we need to quit bowing down to obama .
you sold out rand paul .
forget a balanced budget .
sorry lindsey , don &apos;t be an opportunist .
its not like i can vote for rand .
i &apos;d like to hear him talk about resigning .
god bless you , trey
you lost my vote aunt lindsey and many , many more
mr. congressman , i am a republican .
obama is too effing stupid to understand this ..
lamborn is neither truthful nor does he care .
unfortunately rohrabacher is too tall to be vp for rand .
merry christmas , rand !
end the irs and federal reserve .
you sir need to go home and stay there !
please defund bho &apos;s amnesty ploy ! ! ! !
call out that rino .
brynn , jesus would give of his own money .
its great to know there are other men of integrity and character as marco .
consider someone outside the dc machine .
yeah but we all know obama support of israel is fake !
pray america ! ! !
go mia and strike down this terrible piece of legislature .
yes to trey gowdy for majority leader !
stop this crazy spending on illegal acts .
i should have guessed carol is a ron paul supporter .
i noticed some people wanting you to endorse ron paul .
i am praying for racial unity
the problem is not immigration , it is the act of illegal immigration !
and happy thanksgiving to you and your family mr. trey gowdy
the eo &apos;s by obama are not unconstitutional .
in obamas own words ; we won .
james , thanks for making the smart decision .
impeach obama and he won &apos;t veto it .
later rand .
rand paul for president of the universe !
and this is why scott angelle will not get my vote .
congress , senate and president is not listening to the people .
i am praying for the lord to change our president &apos;s heart too .
not watching he don &apos;t care about america and he lie &apos;s .
no syrian refugees in tn .
senator paul , i am in agreement with you on a great many issues .
too bad we didn &apos;t rally when it came time for a new speaker
thank the lord for our 2nd amendment rights ! ! !
trey if you like him , i am all for him
why did risch and crapo vote to give up the internet ?
none of you do your job and are just wasting our time .
the collective goodwill of all of colorado goes out to you rand .
obama is only fullfilling a promise ... to brazos aka george sorros .
kinda late to the party aren &apos;t you ?
voted for liberty !
congratulations to you , tim , but even more appropriate is congratulations to us .
impeachment is in the wings .
bring the heat mia !
he &apos;s resigning just like pope benedict
no limit on the debt .
we should be ashamed to have a national debt !
yes no war we would all lose ! ! !
now they promise $ 1- $ 40 spending cuts .
you are one of the good guys trent franks ..
he did it all all we have to do is believe !
pass a repeal bill again .
do not do like fast and furious .
call a press conference and publicly tell them no
we need to increase the debt ceiling .
all this spying has not ever stopped one terrorist attack .
louie gohmert , a true patriot and man of integrity .
your turn in 2016 , senator paul !
prayers owing up
we south carolinians are proud of mr. gowdy !
the democrats are doing just that with pelosi , reid , obama !
wow , a sam is a mean thing .
does 1john 3.6 mean that no christian ever sins ? ?
however ... snowden had a security clearance which gave him acces to classified information .
no pulling pork
no more immigration from muslim countries !
we know you are going to do great work for sc .
say no to ryan .
bring out the cases against obama and go for the jugular .
reversing socialist agenda
obama doesn &apos;t want america to prosper .
i am leaving the republican party because of traitors like paul ryan .
sen. scott , please change the filibuster rules in the senate .
why did you vote for obamas tpa deal .
scott desjarlais happy independence day to you !
when are you going to begin impeachment proceedings
the real enemies of america .
very poor schools in south carolina
trey happy thanksgiving .
i just hope the fine people of south carolina vote you out of office .
he said he would not vote to repeal until a replacement was in place .
now obama will run the table and the us into the ground .
spend another 2 million and you still will not have my vote emily cain ....
ron paul 2016 ! !
we don &apos;t need to replace him this year !
the rinos are no different or better than the dems .
yep , when you cut spending , govt does less , what a surprise .
so marsha , where is your plan ?
can &apos;t wait to take our country back in 2010 .
defund it , use your only power .
mr. gowdy , merry christmas !
please impeach him
trey gowdy , hes our man un dc !
trust god and only god .
christie is done for me and many others .
i heard you on fox &amp; friends this morning .
close your borders send back all these young males back .
senator mccain please keep speaking up .
i am even happier that he donates money to people like lankford .
so he wants us to read and understand his son &apos;s vote .
you disappointed the teachers of oklahoma .
good luck and god bless you , mia !
happy anniversary sen and mrs. mccain ! ! ! !
well said lindsey ..
mr. vern , support america &apos;s sick and dying 9 / 11 first responders .
replace this loser with a real conservative .
move on and do what government is supposed to do .
this president has gone to far !
he can pull through if he fires the people around him .
i know that the blackburn family had a great christmas !
diane and all the republican delegation are voting together !
obamacare needs to be repealed and revamped .
definitely not qualified
i know you &apos;ll do sc proud , as always !
get obummer out of office !
we true patriots must now rededicate ourselves to the principles that make america exceptional .
you have asked us to defend ours .
you know , i just might start to like sen. mccain
dear sen. senator marco rubio , i will write in your name in ca .
just pray to god
bad for america , bad for israel .
and yet you do not sponsor the zadroga bill expired last night .
i didn &apos;t see congressman goodlatte complaining during the bush administration .
the majority of people in florida did not support rubio .
we need to set up a recall flake campaign .
i think the whole government is a bunch of liars ......
nora carter raymond , but raising the debt ceiling would be all on him .
mccain you are my hero !
holy cow ... america has been waiting over 6 yrs for the replacement .
fly the american flag seems to be a dc
that you , rand !
the senate does not originate taxes !
it &apos;s not up to the government to distribute the wealth in this country .
harry reid needs to go !
and term limits and a balanced budget no raising the debt ceiling
i wish rand paul were president .
more people than you know are supporting you in their prayers .
if serious about the liberty movement then vote for gov .
replace it with bohner care ?
god bless you mia love always on point !
now you &apos;re really going to defund pp ?
why is nothing being done about obama .
i dig mia love !
rand paul , do you really understand the presidents tax .
primary isakson !
utah voted a law that is against the constitution .
mr. amash , you have lots of supporters all over the states .
does that mean the potus can kill any american in the usa ?
the 2nd ammendment says : &quot; shall not infringe . &quot;
nothing good can come from obamacare that benefits the american people .
you &apos;ve lied about the emails .
marco will rise 10 more points on crist !
we need constitutional immigration reform not executive amnesty .
until we get rid of obama , we will have this waste .
rand paul right as usual !
now we have the tsa with their hands in our pants .
... silence ... you my man tom are part of the problem .
your a great man trey you and your family have a great one
carly fiorina is slowly winning me over .
whether you want change or not , devos is not qualified to institute them .
mr. congressman , you totally sold out the american people .
impeach the immigrant ... &gt; ! !
republican party is in disarray and we still don &apos;t what his policies are .
praying for you and your family daily ! !
please do not re-elect boehner as speaker !
because he knows the military is not with him or the demmie rat party
why does mccain want war with russia so bad ?
no way we are going to let cain take this seat .
at least justin amash has the guts to stand up to him .
cut the budget to obama &apos;s private army
no no ! ! ! !
i hope you and mccain are shown the door after this next election .
christie has crossed to the dark side .
stop obama , that &apos;s what you was elected to do .
dave ramsey says presidents can &apos;t create jobs.so whats up ?
way to go marco
eric holder in drag ?
y &apos;all need to impeach him and stop talking do it enough is enough .
come on ted , vote against boehner .
comey has given the republicans the fuel for the fire .
and get rid of these liberal judges in our state !
right on senator scott !
jack &apos;s off with obama
amen tom well said .
allow both parties to more fully scrutinize ms devos .
wish i lived in kentucky just so i could vote for you
he &apos;s committing an impeachable offense if he does .
for rand .
james ... that is exactly what they want you and us to believe .
open the debates for 3rd party people .
bring articles of impeachment against his imperial highness barack obama .
mia , you make way too much sense !
marco rubio is correct .
rand paul you are what america needs !
go back to the yacht club and party like you usually do , vern .
moran for president !
so darn true ! !
vote hillary and rid us of boehner mcconnell mccain ryan and co
file those criminal charges yourself !
most americans want congress to reform the tax code and sign the jobs bill .
i think our leaders have turned evil and against god
joe butler really bummed we didn &apos;t get a chance to elect rubio .
the president has no legislative authority at all ..
i do believe mr. higgins will win this .
i asked tammie wilson to consider stepping into your position when the time comes .
is everyone still drinking the free whiskey ! ! ! ! ! !
devos is not the person for this job .
even the moderators were trying to get in the debate .
you know , conservative .
i would have ... ended up walking with thune supporters !
ryan is so safe ; hates trump ... thinking of career ...
i know that in obamacare there are exemptions and subsidies for a select few .
wish rep. palazzo could see the dangers instead of following ted cruz .
cut the military spending ! !
he is in default in honoring his oath of office ... god help us ...
amen , senator paul .
yes , we must keep praying for our brave boys overseas and their families ..
no ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
we very much need option b !
senator mccain , you are the one our country needed inside the white house .
because your president is a muslim himself vern
you have already lost my vote in the next election .
i supported mr king all throughout the huge immigration bill fight .
i want my i stand with rand button !
repeal the whole thing !
bill clinton and the word impeach don &apos;t ring a bell ?
mr. graham , you are worthless .
thanks , mia .
he also was with john mccain and stood behind obama for going to syria .
no we need to start thinking about a new government .
stop sending our money overseas .
i hope your fellow senators shun you and john mccain for your irresponsible comments .
please mr. gowdy please help .
patrick when have they let fact get in the way ?
you just addressed nothing mike .
sorry for your loss congresman young i am praying for both of you
proud for you ... and south carolina .
joni , why did you vote for boehner today ?
may god give you wisdom !
the 14th amendment just so you know , is part of the constitution !
signed god !
god bless you for all you have done for our nation !
3 ) debt &quot; increase the national debt to an unsustainable level . &quot;
congratulations from lubbock texas
impeach obamma bin laden !
voting down in tucson for gabby &apos;s replacement tomorrow .
although our constitution say ..... you know
a little too late to mention trump by name paul ryan .
you should know about useless spending .
despicable ! ... you never cease to amaze me mr. scott .
lindsey graham , i do not appose immigration .
they are working so hard to cut any aid to those babies they can .
you are one of the only true conservatives in public office .
the constitution is for americans .
you all have enough to impeach three presidents ! ! !
please listen to the people you represent and vote no , senator lamar alexander !
how many spending cuts have we made in the 112th congress ?
getting a little irritated here rand .
i agree tom .
no money for you , you need a pink slip
how about leading the fight to get rid of the epa period
obamacare can kiss my derriere !
and you have plenty of support to bring impeachment proceedings against obama
can i get cuban cigars now ?
god bless and with god &apos;s speed stop this !
welcome to our wonderful wacko bird club !
what did you expect from an administration that ignores the constitution ?
mr gowdy you are a man i deeply respect for what you stand for !
south carolina is so blessed to have mr. gowdy !
thanks for fighting this nonsense , marsha .
blessings to the gowdy family from our american family !
of course this will not happen because your only conservative about certain things .
the whole republican party again has been outsmarted by a man with kenyan ancestry .
some moved to utah and idaho !
has anyone in this administration read the bill yet ?
obamacare is a massive fraudulent scheme , to get re-elected &amp; grab power .
i , for one , am sick of imperial bureaucracies , irs too ,
i am sure obummer loves you for screwing your voters
marsha blackburn , please step down from office .
ronald reagan then george bush !
rubio for president
and his so called plan is more spending !
i have no idea what graham was thinking .
jeb should have been booted .
isn &apos;t that supposed to be the conservative way ?
keep up the good work and we &apos;ll keep up the prayers .
god knows how .
prayers for you mia !
well written tom mcclintock .
do what you think you can to stop the spending nonsense .
wonder if his lips hurt from kissing barry hussein &apos;s butt so much ?
let &apos;s enforce the immigration laws we already have on the books .......
johnson and clinton were tried , but the impeachment failed .
also most everything in obamacare were republican ideas .
why are you not interviewing obama ?
betsy devos has zero interest in educating the children of the us .
he is arrogantly betting on voters being uniformed and complacent .
people fired for irs , nsa , benghazi and fast and furious .
good job selling out your country , kev !
defund is best , but it wouldn &apos;t pass the senate .
praying also
repeal the obama health care act , its bad news from the get-go .
brett defund nsa !
this is already in operation thru kansas .
tim scott , 102 shares in an hour .
and is in the pocket of obummer
good luck and may god bless you !
impeach and fire the rest of those creeps !
no guts no glory !
you are right ted yoho !
you guys will even compromise your basic principles to get elected .
love rand , hate he stuck with the elephant in the room
rand do something about guantanamo c &apos;mon already !
thanks for voting to take money away from our military and military retirees .
they humiliate us in front of our allies and build up our enemies .
why dosent congress impeach him for treason ?
mid term tom !
a true patriot who loves his country and our constitution .
congratulations rep. lankford !
my question when has he ever put anything re our country first .
maine needs bruce poliquin ! ! ! !
like the 2000 + pages of obama care .....
you must not be up for vote if you don &apos;t cruz with a ted
the president will fix that one with his veto .
common core and budget
and anyone who is a friend of the castro brothers is my enemy .
scott , the individual mandate covers about 10 % of the country .
because fox tells the truth ?
then impeach obama
we need to eliminate leadership from behind despite media &apos;s liberal bias .
arizonans are wanting a true conservative to rep our state !
no compromise on reducing debt and deficit .
don &apos;t talk do something about it .
good for you sir keep it up
i was gonna chime in on lankford needs to be voted out .
keep up the good work mia love .
praying for family .... god bless so sorry ......
james , did they all need to be opposed ?
unfortunately jeanette , harry reid wouldn &apos;t even let us vote on it today .
please quit wasting our time with you running for president .
we haven &apos;t been living under the us constitution for a long long time .
and don &apos;t even think about taking another hostage with the debt ceiling .
mark sanford is terrible .
they have been more useful to obama than harry reid ever was
no it didn &apos;t , well then obviously a stand down was issued
the last amnesty only caused more illegal immigration .
oh paul , you sold your soul .
and today sir , you did not !
one path can rebuild the republican party .
i am very disappointed in how weak the republican party has become .
are conservatives now the majority or not !
go get &apos;em , rand !
yes he has risen happy easter.god bless you trey
rand will always be my first pick for president .
thanksmr mc cain have a blessed easter sunday and passover ! ! ! !
i think mccain is a under cover liberal / democrat
would that not be a high crime and an impeachable offense ?
senator , don &apos;t try to play the conservative guy now .
she embarrasses tn every time she opens her mouth !
well , what about his position on illegals and amnesty ?
an answer to our prayers !
stand up to him and force him to stop these unjust executive orders .
we are counting on true conservatives like you to insist .
the debt ceiling has nothing to do with spending cuts .
unfortunately , obama is not a leader ...
no one will want to pay rate increases caused by the epa .
republicans control the house and senate and you still caved .
senator graham i don &apos;t know if you read these posts .
i guess your right , mr .
rinos and democrats see the constitution as a roadblock to their agenda .
truly a rino !
i am a conservative but you haven &apos;t exactly supported us either .
well put rand paul
no ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
i agree with danielle .. have you lost your mind ?
nothing , because i would place no confidence in anything he says .
all of you crooks in washington need to vote no on this bill !
coming against our constitution is an impeachable offense .
obama is getting ridiculous , and dangerous .
mr. inhofe i am from southwest oklahoma !
do not approve any funds for taking care of the illegals .
depends on johnny football !
rino traitor ! !
they already fear obamacare and the corruption they have concocted will be repealed .
oh right , conservatives need their daily dose of oil with their republican oatbran .
more revenue for a president and out of control spending .
obama is just a clone of bush .
proud of you sen. rand .
no american should be forced into socialized medicine .
his impending impeachment !
we can follow the constitution and still have success .
the united states has the constitution and i love the constitution .
gooo mccain
i support a consumption flat tax .
no more debt increases or it will kill every small business owner in america .
mr burr you should resign immediately !
no ryan , ss was a pyramid scheme from the beginning .
just remember to be a true republican
this is why i left the republican party .
holder is blocking every ruling which includes their gang of thieves .
he will do anything he wants .
he lists in his book other actions obama already has initiated by executive order .
immigration and obama care
james i hope you can talk some common sense into our leaders in washington .
your support means you have lost my vote when / if you run again .
you sir are a complete disappointment .
i do believe you are hinting at the government
mrs. devos has repeatedly shown that she is unqualified to hold this position .
that flag did not have nothing to do with that killing .
our government was set up with the idea that government served the people .
don &apos;t vote for boehner
quit spending mine !
god bless you mia and a wonderful statement .
obama will be impeached very very soon over this
i can &apos;t wait until rand paul runs in 2016 ....
speaks loud for paul for aclu to be against , go rand .
when did mcclintock earn his constitutional law degree ?
he is a citizen and deserves every protection under the constitution .
he doesn &apos;t care about the spending problem .
resignation
obama and holder should be in prison
i love mia love .

robert hayes wrote : &quot; ans ( 2 ) .
tom you should talk to your blm surveyors .
you don &apos;t poll south carolinians on important decisions ! !
this administration is corrupt , inept , and not held accountable .
take a page out of this ryan !
lets fix this problem and impeach obama .
why is the tea party working on something the president will veto ?
obamacare is the republican plan .
taxpayers want to see some action to balance the budget .
our main stream news publishing an opinion piece is a 5th amendment right .
praying for these families
now if we can get that other rhino mitch mcconnell to resign .
i stiil havent heard why or how the debt is hurting any of you .
he at least has the guts to put it out there !
you sir are no leader if you do this .
sir can u impeach obama
you kick ass johnny !
all they can now is talk bad about him and cut him down .
praying for you and all our leaders daily .
i hope selling out american school children keeps you up at night .
ga needs to find an american to run against you in the primary .
yes congressman steven palazzo
please reconsider and vote no on cloture , senator .
do something tim scott !
hats off to america &apos;s friend and statesman , trey gowdy !
impeachment solves nothing .
we have the fbi that could use their budget .
sen. mccain you , ignorant bigot , get out of office .
elderly dictator castro who still runs his grandfathers country .
you represent roseville yet you act like another dc big government republican .

if you did sen. graham might do same since he follows whatever you do .
sc should be proud .
thanks , tim , keep us informed .
congrat &apos;s to you rand !
susan , we might survive obama , but our freedoms will be gone .
obama said he would veto this bill and he did .
lee would have been killed easy to prep for lee .
then let them own it just the way it was voted on .
do you republican law makers have no backbone ?
we vote for you to defend the constitution for us .
this is too little and too late
rubio is stricter because his descendants were most likely persecuted in cuba .
we need a dozen trey gowdys .
mr. mccain , you are the reason i &apos;m no longer a republican .
the house can vote to repeal it all they want .
i have been impressed with mia love since her 1st run
8 years ron 8 years rand and our nation will be great again !
stick to cut , cap and balance .
voting thom tillis !
those articles of impeachment !
enjoy the blood money , traitor .
because they are more than likely small public universities that just want tax dollars
mr. poe you pulled a john cornyn .
secure the borders .
perhaps rubio is wrong , but right now , i would welcome that moat .
someone needs to remove this president &amp; charge him with treason .
government spending and the deficit both broke new ground under reagan !
potus is doing what he said he would .
hannity is of no value .
boehner needs to go as speaker .
we have an immigration system and it is not broken .
you , paul ryan are a closet democrat rino ! ! !
i got my vote for rand on the car
then you will have the &quot; banana republic &quot; that obama really wants .
back to the issues .... ty sen mccain .
write in rubio !
go get em bob .
that way obama will make sure they get housing , healthcare and cash .
mccain is a coward .
you have ruined and embarrassed yourself mccain .
if amnesty beomes a unilateral move , will it matter who supports what ?
please don &apos;t let them in south dakota either ! !
exactly , steven carp , congress needs to quit yapping and do something .
yes the truth hurts but how long before obma has rand taken out
rand wants to get rid of government and give all the power to corporations .
c yall are destoying america by creating a socialistic welfare society
we will take our country back from this muslim dictator ..... watch and see .
keep gitmo , where else are you going to put the terrorist ?
i think this administration forgot israel is an ally .

killary paid comey off ! !
i have to agree 100 % with my husband repeal it and fast !
has the same authority that reagan and bush sr did when they did it .

obama is not eligible to be president .
obama is taking grazing land from ranchers , water from farmers etc .
keep going sen. mccain ignore the lefts attack on you .
paul 2012 paul 2016 paul 2020 : )
how do you forget that classified documents are to be kept on secure servers ?
as we traveled through kentucky we saw miles and miles of road improvements .
congressman , just do a clean cr .
mia love when you run for president i will for sure vote for you !
i wonder if that would affect people like paul ?
it is time to compromise not stand your ground .
we the people want the patriot act gone !
merry christmas to you too sir !
this could help balance our budget and put some stability back in our markets .
you call obama a socialist but he &apos;s been using republican policies .
boehner has to go .

the emperor is wearing no clothes ! ! !

and obama wants us to let go of our firearms .
good luck.my besta tim
praise god and live by the golden rule .
please work on illegals receiving benefits and border security
you sir need to here us and join us .
how about getting rid of obama ?
how about repealing federal gasoline / diesel taxes .
he hates america and so does his wife .
james and justin both start with j. coincidence ?
lindsey e. mask - know anybody ?
i feel like this is what you and rep. scott desjarlais did .
you have the backbone of a noodle sir .
if the federal government would stick with fed .
obama never served in the military .
the constitution , mr. paul , is all we have left .
no nominee is good enough for republicans , even a republican !
yall need to get rid of the obamacare .
mia speaks the truth .
and the constitution is just fine and there are no grounds for impeachment .
impeach barry sotoro .
living in a constitutional republic commands honoring said constitution .
isn &apos;t it great our 4th amendment rights have been suspended with out notification !
we oppose betsy devos because she is so ridiculously , horrifically unqualified .
mia , i wish more elected representatives understood this !
make it happen paul !
turbyfill , absolutely not .
im not an obama hater , these are the facts .
he is probably the worst this country has seen .
we are praying !
eric holder will do nothing .. he &apos;s protecting obama .
from california with love !
whos fault is that , mr pres
premiums have gone up 28 % under obama .
no need he is gone anyway !
today you forgot about the children of north carolina
thanks for nothing paul ryan
duh ! ! ! ! ! !
legislation sounds good sir , but will it be enforced ?
i mean it , defund them immediately ! ! !
i am a conflicted person when it comes to obamacare .
tim scott for president 2024 !
dream on tom , that is not the objective of &quot; that guy &quot; .
go rand , god bless
mia is the next mlk
a five ounce bird cannot carry a 1 pound coconut .
more ammunition to use in sending emily cain packing !
nice job selling out the american people john .
only 28 % believes that this monster amnesty will secure the border .
hey mitch mcconnell i just wanted to say ur a joke .
stay kind , mia !
this is who john mccain , barack obama , lindsey graham want to support .
we the people want him charged with treason
but he doesn &apos;t believe in our constitution .
why can &apos;t bo understand that ? !
luv you mia love !
i wish my kentucky congressman was half the public servant you are !
that he will force congress to release irs form 8863 for education credits immediately !
scott , i can &quot; factually support &quot; all of my arguments .
maybe you can teach lindsey how to vote no .
i &apos;m tired of this president thinking he is the law of the land .
ron paul is the only opposition .
president makes friends with communist cuba and islhamic middle east .
bo is just looking for a way to take out assad .
ted cruz is a liar .
biggest obamacare lie = it will create jobs &amp; boost the economy .
maybe marco rubio in 2017 .
we conservatives aren &apos;t against helping those who really need help .
will also pray for you and all the government workers .
and obama will be impeached !
thannk you , mia .
god bless you and your family ryan : - ) ) ) ) ) )
don &apos;t pass it unless there are cuts , do not agree to tax hikes
all this would end if you would listen to sheriff joe and impeach obama .
if congress could stop imports , , we would all have jobs
we believe in our republican senate and congress and your good leadership .
i agree obama is the one trying to destroy america from the inside
deb , o is a constitutional lawyer .
cathy we pay you to watch over government spending .
you obviously do not listen to the people in your district .
yo arein our prayers !
vote no , cut spending , cut debt , vote yes on term limits
jesse &gt; the president is not the law .
our government is made up of dishonest , thieving politicians .
right on rand , your friend from lake jackson , texas proud of you !
spending on detention facilities for illegals .
you &apos;ll always have my support when you defend liberty !
america is special because of its constitution - follow it !
you are very much mistaken , sir .
this country needs men like you and sen cruz
anything less than impeachment of the potus is not acceptable to me .
term limits johnny time for you to go ! !
mr scott is the type of leader we need today .
take back the senate in 2014 and hold the house--then go for impeachment .
now it is time for you to stand up for securing our borders !
i voted for you , and i voted for romney .
try repealing obama so we can get back on the right track
if obama and holder hate him he must be a good man .
i respect and agree with everything trey says .
because thx to the liberals and socialist there are not enough votes
why and how is obama still in office ?
first : eliminate obama !
the flag had nothing to do with it , lost my vote sir
there is no common ground with someone who believes they are above the law .
there is no common sense .
our tax code is ridiculous - we need the fair tax !
please keep up the fight for conservative principles .
we need to stay out of this and worry about our own problems .
just ask any saudi citizen .
steven is why our country is in the shape it &apos;s in .
praying there are enough votes to over-ride a sure veto .
good for you senator rand paul
have more town hall meetings as well
a check and balance to the executive orders being signed by this administration
this admin does not get it
god bless you senator ...
i think prices of medical care is ridiculous but obamacare is not the answer .
happy thanksgiving trey gowdy &amp; family god bless
part of the marxist plan .
if he does it , then all of congress should have him arrested .
a flat tax with no exemptions , credits , earmarks or loopholes sounds good .
i enjoyed watching you speak tonight on cnn sir !
the constitution does not say our arms are limited to certain types .
they are god &apos;s chosen
please , please find a way to impeach this tyrant .
rand paul , you lost my vote forever with your endorsement for romney .
we don &apos;t care what you think is best for georgia .
trey gowdy for speaker
pray so .
america please wake up and vote republican nazis out of office
especially in egypt this time .
you do nothing under the thumb of boehner .
more bigotry from the &quot; sinator &quot; ; voting against cloture on s.815.
you evil conservatives are always taking him out of context .
like father like son ron paul for president ,
no to war rand .
resisting unlawful spending is enforcing the constitution .
you ment to say , pray for the republican party we need it .
get on the trump train mccain or get on the bus with the libtards !
i pray to the lord above that he will provide us a real leader .
estamos contigo marco !
he has been in office a year and still can &apos;t bet past bush .
you have a control problem im no doctor i suggest you go see one
do not let the downward pull of washington take you with it .
we we will continue praying for this to move forward .
you took a pledge to support the nominee .
gowdy for president .
oooops .... forgot i am a conservative !
memo from internet after they discovered al-qaeda was behind benghazi attack .
so , what is congress going to do to correct this , thom ?
obama needs to go now
now do your job as a republican and give your support to our choice .
grand-standing obama backing rino windbag .
he has already given you his mind .
the federal government does not have that power .
then stop him johnny !
good work , mr. scott desjarlais .
you wanna do something tom ? ?
this is just a ploy to get us to let down our guard .
we have got to primary in georgia !
still praying
17 months and no action ?
ben sasse is a joke .
even if you do obama will still do it
americans solidly oppose an increase in the debt ceiling .
oh , and way to listen to your constituents .
merry christmas doc to you and your family - god bless
they knew the president would veto the bill .
we need you in the white house , marco !
gitmo serves no worthwhile purpose .
i like our present voice in congress , please stand firm .
trey do not give up an inch until you get to the truth .
where were the fiscal conservatives then ?
an australian who knows his government needs to do better .
he has broke the law and has failed to uphold the constitution !
after this they should impeach obama ( without a request ) in one vote !
( please , ensure the hispanic run-a-ways are not now dumped in florida .
he must apologize for something he said 11 years ago ?
mccain please lead the charge .
when has he ever stood up to obama .
obamacare should have never passed .
repeal repeal repeal .
you need to tell the others to not sell out we the people .
fbi is bought by the clinton &apos;s .
mia , what have you actually done and accomplished ?
stating that fact does not make senator scott guilty of slander .
thank the lord for god fearing government authorities .
somehow , i doubt that obama will do that .
keep up good conservative work and it &apos;ll happen !
are you praying for his death too ?
praying for all these situations .
not very many conservatives have stood up and sounded off nationally as needed .
any proposed laws are being rightfully sent to congress for debate and vote .
you &apos;re right , paul ryan .
i &apos;m proud to say i voted for scott .
and if the gop keep caving in esp .
may god be with them all
betsy devos is horribly unqualified with absolutely no credentials or experience for this position .
i haven &apos;t had to take any of the others down either !
this debate is being moderated much more professionally moderated than the fox debate
rand paul would be the worst president ever .
you have some nerve to say a word about spending .
please keep cutting , marsha .
yea he has no right to be in charge of his own department .
every single person that voted for this administration is responsible for this unqualified disaster .
their more socialist than france .
happy thanksgiving trey xo
but bo is bound and deterrmined to bankrupt us .
then you have absolutely no credibility , sir .
or perhaps when reagan hosted the taliban at the white house ?
preaching to the choir here-i agree !
we need mccain
its not wacko bird , its freedom bird !
counting on you to not let the socialist demorats play games !
because if the public knows it , it &apos;s no longer secure .
start the impeachment process ! ! ! !
reagan and you if you ran
you are still the second most awesome congressman we have mr. amash .
he has done things like that before and he can do it again .
have you noticed how senator cruz never hesitates when he speaks .
keep them out of kansas .
wear it with honor sen. rand
raise taxes where it is appropriate and cut spending where appropriate .
god bless you in your loss .
jeff flake , john mccain over immigration : help recall or primary the senator !
that the irs will need approx 13,000 new agents for the job ?
we will be watching greta and you !
obama is unbelievably petulant , petty and cruel !
there are no direct flights from west africa to the us !
impeach him , enough is enough .
typical whimp rino jumping on the band wagon after emerging your safe space ....
i agree , tell marc rubio and jeb bush no !
boehner = out !
i believe that mccain is losing it ! !
mcclintock for president ! !
and that is why you will get my vote every time jerry .
thanks for citizen &apos;s united , mitch .

once again the liberal agenda lies are exposed .
can you honestly say he is a traitor for doing that ?
he was a communist remember .
absolutely cut them off .
as far as i &apos;m concerned you sir are fired .
kerry was a traitor and lied about vietnam .
maybe we need to quit paying taxes .
didn &apos;t mia love vote for boehner in january ?
obama has lied again and again , not just about this !
jaimie , i encourage you on to real reform , abolish the irs code .
obama is just as stupid and dysfunctional and the rest of you elected officials .
you are right mia love .... as we see no future .
obama does not have a clue .
help us , ted poe .
a goal without a plan is just a dream ! !
praying you don &apos;t leave us .....
there you go , cut those aid off !
senator david perdue why is congress so afraid to impeach obama ?
god bless america please ! ! !
congress can defund this .
please stand up for the constitution and oppose this poorly conceived executive action .
um greg .
air force you know put them up in the air .
no one else could have said this any better tim
instead mr. poe is tossing softballs out here mixed with partisan talking points .
a fast and successful impeachment process and conclusion
north carolina .
trey goff
another reason to seal out borders .
i really don &apos;t understand why liberals get on conservative pages .
if it were up to us , you would absolutely not be in washington .
voting you out lamar
we put you in office and we can throw you out !
you &apos;re a few days old on this , though tom .
no water ? ? ?
happy easter to you and your family sir .
god bless you for standing up for our country ! ! !
our nation cannot stand up to the debt that the aca will cost us .
i agree congressman
now is the time to repeal and replace .
i hope and pray that a potential run for president is in your future !
it is a guaranteed constitutional right .
i really believe barak has lost his mind .
our administration is totally out of control .
there are no american national security interests .
i support mo brooks and i am a conservative gop voter .
that &apos;s the spirit , mia !
god sees all and you will be held accountable to him someday .
there &apos;s a reason congress has a 9 % approval rating .
you first mr speaker .
we have elected y &apos;all to fix the mess .
bless your heart &amp; god bless !
please do all you can to impeach this mad man .
i pray he does not do it unilaterally .
i live in sc and we love trey gowdy .
totally oppose !
i have no confidence in this potus
its too late now .
no increase in debt ceiling !
send them to cuba .
if the main stream media was even a little balanced , it would improve .
the clintons can get away with anything or o it seams .
go rand paul , we love you , fight those tsa .
there is only a tax on what you spend .
yes to defund , no to cloture
sorry ... my iq is too high to watch fox !
your word says we should pray for our enemies so thats what im doing .
pick a new topic with obamacare .
my heart is breaking with you tim .
i am completely for obamacare !
i agree but some of the republican party doesn &apos;t .
tell it mia , now impeach his muslim ass
i don &apos;t want you to vote yes for anything that funds obamacare .
in the same way christians pray for sinners , out of love .
get rid of common core in the schools .
the spending has to get under control .
happy thanksgiving to you and your family , rand !
they all should be impeached .
i like paul and rubio alot , neither as president however .
may god bless you sir ! !
please tell us mr scott all the changes this pipeline will make .
boehner sabotaged america by giving obama everything he wanted .
you need to get out of senate
i am so thankful for leaders like you mr. scott .
you are not listening to wyoming parents or educators !
hey i have an idea impeach obama ! ! !
take away the executive order power he has limit his mouth !
rubio for president in 2016 ! ! !
president rand paul ! ! !
vote to pass a clean cr .
she is a socialist / communist
thanks james for your dedication to the oil field and oklahoma !
that &apos;s a bad deal for america !
19 times during reagan and bush 43 the debt ceiling was raised .
no more rino
that plan has not worked under the bush administration .
very classy post tim scott .
stop spending our hard earned money .
i heard he is , mike .
i &apos;m disappointed in his backing rubio .
just do what you need to do and support the republican nominee senator .
we need more people like you in congress rand !
isis johnny , it &apos;s isis .
he &apos;s another worthless rino
got anyone in mind , paul ?
rand paul you are a hero !
i really apreciate that rand did this for the people .
they could at least import from our friends in south and central america .
and what is congress or vern going to do nothing .
i guess the republicans would never try to stall a president &apos;s nominee .
that &apos;s not the only unconstitutional thing he has done .
if we can be guaranteed of a specific sales tax rate - e.g.
i pray you will consider it .
i have no insurance either .
do not vote for obamacare
thank rand paul for voting against the violense against women act . &quot;
you must not even be following what james lankford is doing for you !
pass a clean cr and then negotiate all you want .
lou barletta is a fellow coal cracker from hazleton .
we don &apos;t either but change that amnesty for illegals that you are for .
we need jobs but nothing is being done by this admin .
relieved here too kourtney that mike lee won .
so when are you going to do anything about this mess .
but why can &apos;t we do something about it ?
that being said , mccain is wrong .
get rid of it and the expense associated with it .
cruz is far more conservative .
only his first name was paul , and his last name was revere !
why is this lawless jackass not being impeached ?
you and ryan boy .
any other president would have been impeached and thrown out years ago !
not sure what obama is thinking .
congress needs another vacation along with the president and should be a permanent vacation .
we won &apos;t default as long as we pay the interest !
my father could not get the va to very much for him .
that would be ronald reagan was a true american
pray for us all ! !
option b. houston desperately needs more mass transit .
if congress got together senate and house the president will do what he wants .
bill is left of obama , can you just be honest ?
merry christmas and prayers for a brighter 2016 .
eat crow , rino !
get hose borders closed now !
rep. buchanan , where are the good jobs in sarasota ?
i &apos;m liking trey gowdy more and more .
i pray for you daily !
you &apos;ve upset a lot of us here in sc with this .
impeach the communist that stole the whitehouse .
as our president in 2016 and you will get our country back on track .
obama has kept us out of another great depression .
the internet sales tax .
it is absolutely clear from reading story that serious political offenses are impeachable offenses .
maybe he will cut an executive order and nominate himself ?
a credit to south carolina .
no fetus is pain capable at 20 weeks .
senator corker - one of conservatives who i look to for rationality .
stand with rand 2016 ! ! !
homeland security secretary napolitano is clueless as to what constitutes effective border security .
love u gowdy
god bless you trey gowdy ! !
rand thanks for trying .
option b. thanks for asking
do the right thing and listen to your constituents .
could we arm our soldiers too ?
not one republican voted for this mess .
the only way to have accountability is to fire the entire govt .
this is what you get paid when you support johnny boehner .
john barrasso is also a liar .
it will only get worse unless congressmen like you keep it before the people .
crap ... i sounded like john mccain there for a second .
i loved seeing lindsey get pissed off at cnn anchor , republicans today
no replacement needed or wanted .
miss ya lou .
emily cain needs to bow out .
let &apos;s pray not
the president believes nothing will happen to him .
seal our borders ..... no amnesty ! ! ! !
boehner is for whatever butters boehner &apos;s bread .
the answers to all people questions lies in that word , love you mia .
so nice of all of you to help him keep the ins .
time for christie and fiorina to drop out !
make it uglier and uglier to reid till he sees the trend !
rubio -v- crist .
stop embarrassing north carolina and step down .
go ahead , lindsey .
at least marino didn &apos;t cave in !
and maybe while we &apos;re at it we &apos;ll put you traitors out !
hispanic sympathizers voted for obama and continue !
stand up for what is right moran .
he and biden resign !
mr. isakson , i see you voted for the amnesty bill .
the irs is a total disaster .
just enforce the ones we have .
i &apos;d gladly take him and sara palin over obama
rand is wrong on this .
you are in my prayers man !
poor mitch mcconnell has you under his thumb !
mia love for vice president !
i &apos;m a north carolina voter and i will remember how you vote .
that wording is there to provide cover for these traitor senators .
be ye therefore blessed
well said , marco rubio 2016 !
he thinks he makes the law !
your are standing tall dr paul .
if you fund it you own it .
time is very very short before it is too late .
doing two simple things will practically stop illegal immigration .
please stand your ground for our nation .
no it will not !
use common sense and get off the party line !
no excuses for killing our unborn souls !
james believes what the bible the says to be true .
thanks for all you do in washington for south dakota and the whole nation .
the federal government already ignores the constitution .
if only the congress would be shut down with the rest of the government .
the actual traitors are the ones in office who got caught spying on us !
please do not vote for this rushed repeal .
jerry orm
how does the senate have the authority to vote on our constitutional rights ?
the designated liar is being rewarded for her obedience !
if the government shuts down it will be obama &apos;s decision .
go rand help him out .
that he &apos;s quitting early , just resign and go far away from america
why can &apos;t we defund the unelected , unaccountable czars ?
senator mccain we need your wisdom and voice more than ever .
mr gowdy you are a real southern gentleman !
great news senator rubio !
rubio for 2020 !
it was a judicial slap in the face of our law breaking potus
it is in the constitution !
christie should just change parties and get it over with ... rino
the government is in a mess .
mia , would you consider moving to arizona ?
stand up for the conservative side and do not back down .
but current potus doesn &apos;t care , he dislikes the military .
god bless rand paul for opposing the rhinos and thugs .
we will never recover from the full implementation of obamacare .
- most of my fb pals are not from sc .
you were my guy marco .
eric holder has proven himself to be a true patriot .
alabama romney

tim , i &apos;m surprised you didn &apos;t follow mike lee and steve king
amen brother ! ! !
he should have already been replaced .
our southern borders need to be reinforced , rebuilt .
we need no tax on personal income .
being a patriot is standing in opposition to trump .
no congressman , you are not missing anything .
too late socialism is already started .
obama &apos;s selective editing always removes references to god !
conservatives were griping about bush spending too .
would rand consider being secretary of state under trump ?
yes , demand a vote against amnesty for illegal criminals !
the reason we are in a recession is because of government spending .
&apos; bout time we had a senator with guts
the more obama gets away with the further he goes !

trey for president next election ! ! !
im from idaho and would be proud to support mr. gowdy for president !
once upon a time i believed in you mr. ryan .
what all that has gotten us is $ 15,000,000,000,000 in debt !
senator inhofe , obama is not the man to take care of this matter .
i &apos;d move to sc just to vote for you .
i know coffman isn &apos;t a rino but the leadership is .
you are not the wacko
do constitutional carry concealed in north carolina , cut the spending in d c .
epa is a disaster .
i can &apos;t speak for bob .
tim never a good deal to trust terrorists !
stop the dictator now !
do not let them down , fund the zadroga act .
why is obama getting away with criminal activity ?
arrest politicians that intact policies that give drivers license and aid to illegals .
defund it , that is a solution .
this administration doesn &apos;t know the meaning of that word .... truth !
ronald reagan ... he was the first president i voted for ! !
i agree , senator mcconnell .
why they don &apos;t listen anyway
mr. gowdy is the right man for the job ! !
marsha , you are a psuedo conservative .
congress should have started impeachment process on obama already ?
mia , have you seen this report ?
i &apos;m writing in marco rubio for president !
no way , but jesus tells us that we should .
what have the establishment republicans done to stop him .
i guess being a good liar is a requirement to be part of this administration
worthless cowardly hearings , trey gowdy ?
andhe doesn &apos;t have the authority to do so anyway ! ! !
charlie , spoken like a true obama supporter .
so true , and merry christmas and god bless
thanks alot for selling out america !
i cant wait for 2016. rubio all the way .
send every one of them to the border .
ask obama and his cronies joanie kyle
god bless you and my prayers are with you .
listen to your constituents and start listening to your messages .
god will be your defender mr. higgins .
i don &apos;t need decisive slogans , conservative , christian , constitutional all b.s.
my vote goes for trey
might as well put us in there earning your paycheck ryan .
wish they were here now to fix this mess .
obamacare has nothing to do with the budget .
he would love for them to cross the line and challenge his authority .
instead of asking us , why dint you say what you think !
i never thought the confederate flag had a real place on government grounds .
irs &quot; scandal &quot; .
&quot; those who wished to oppose the speaker should have done so then . &quot;
so your solution is to blame obama ?
prayers for all those involved .
wish israel would just let gaza be its own country .
i am very disappointed in our government tonight .
now that obama has socialized it , watch how fast the quality goes downhill .
tom mcclintock is a rare breed , an honest politician .
i agree 100 % that ta needs reinstated .
medicare part b was gutted by obamacare .
we are keeping the fires burning down in south florida marco !
how about i resign
trey gowdy would be excellent as speaker !
bruce poliquin is a mainer for mainers ! ! !
vice president material ... great representation , tim !
your vote for devos will be my reason to vote you out .
because the dems know that the republican will cave .
articles of impeachment should be filed immediately in the house .
obama should be impeached for his actions while in office ! !
i wish you would resign !
the president is on limited time we will vote him out .
repeal is not a fix it is extortion !
# teammitch # zadroga # worstresponders
obama needs to be gone asap .
nicholas , you hit the nail on the head with that statement
i &apos;ve called mcconnell .
the constitution you fought for .
and obamacare was not something this nation could afford financially .
i used to think that you had class , rand .
mr goodlatte , are you drinking the unscientific &quot; fearbola &quot; koolade , too .
no obamacare !
what is a good internet feed for fox news ?
people wanted a change , so they voted for obama .
many of us feel like our freedom is being infringed upon .
and congress let him do it !
and , boehner is officially , and solidly re-elected as speaker again .
congress- spineless
god really does answer prayers !
good man sen shelby
this turmoil happens when you have no presidential leadership .
i don &apos;t.understand you mccain .
obama and john sullivan are laws unto themselves .
lindsey graham is the problem .
how in the world can you call yourself a conservative .
what does israel have to do with government mandated health insurance ?
you are right , mia .
i &apos;ve got questions about your support for aca repeal .
the president is not picking and choosing what cuts should be made .
my father was born and raised in cuba .
does he really think he will be rewarded for his being a turncoat ?
stephane why are you not repealing obamacare if you voted against it ?
senator marco rubio seems to meet the definition , don &apos;t you think ?
please do not compromise with mr. obama and senator reid .
please keep fighting for increased liberty !
obama is making it hard to purchase ammo for the guns .
but , until then ... god help us .
the man taught constitutional law .
john , you have good common sense .
awesome display mr. paul !
please stop obozo before he destroys america .
stop this president who wants to make himself a dictator .
they follow their leader obama !
bush kept cutting taxes and we kept losing jobs .
i support james lankford because he is a man of god .
you are one classy lady , mia .
you need to impeach obama .
we better fall to our knees and pray before we fall as a country .
shame on any one of you guys that shun him ! ! ! !
so thankful for leaders like you mia : - )
especially with obama wanting exclusive say over which &quot; police &quot; get military surplus !
obama promised no new taxes .
refusing to raise the debt limit is deliberately breaking those laws .
ask him if he believes the potus is legal .
mike crapo , what a perfect name for a rino traitor .
doug - you are so full of it .
do not cave on amnesty !
do it johnny .
what is your opinion now that the fbi changed to not so guilty ? ?
deport the current illegals and then begin to protect our borders .
senator marco rubio--right
no cloture on the resolution though , right ?
you go sir !
so , how do you plan to balance it ?
we are from ky
wish you were president , tim !
- fails to secure american borders permitting terrorists to enter the country and criminals !
got get rid of guys like mitch mcconnell and speaker john banierd .
and may god bless you too , senator scott .
repeal the individual mandate ! !
get with the program , mr. mcclintock .
impeach that man if you can call him a man !
why else can govs and presidents override prisoners on death row .
appology to sen ted cruse .
you do not represent me or the great citizens of south carolina .
lots of &lt; 3 trey gowdy !
if he doesn &apos;t then the house should issue articles of impeachment !
and may god bless you , also .
what is so bad in obamacare that harry has to protect the president from ?
i agree with you senator paul .
and god bless you john mic cain
liberty i think it may be a different vote than that .
obama can save us ... he just needs unlimited authority .
please change your position and vote no on devos
no -- defund it now !
we in the bamanation are standing tall and praying for a health speedy recovery .
why should boehner be the one to pick his successor ?
and that was just the beginning of his run away deficit spending spree .
so tell them all to quit talking and balance !
praying everyday for you !
not getting my vote , turncoat , embarrassment to south carolina .
its a bad bill like obama care .
rep. huizenga = please understand what the people really want .... a balanced budget .
this has been a complete failure of mitch mcconnell .
keep buying the votes obama , it &apos;s your only chance .
you have no courage of conviction .
help us lee
the people of south carolina are lucky to have you .
rand , i sure hope your not all talk .
he just wants his pension .
your are such a dork just be quiet-your not your dad
i already early voted for you and pray you have a landslide win .
he is destroying our country
it &apos;s time to begin serving the country , vern .
mr mc clintock- my patriots are mcclintocks ! ! !
do not cave in to them
so i say , so long bye bye establishment from we the people
@ john mccain .
i &apos;m tired of obama .
not capabale of helping our country it seems we can do nothing about it !
i thought a fellow &quot; country boy &quot; would have conservative roots .
if it was called reagan care they would love it .
my new supposed conservative rep garrett graves voted for boehner as did most newbies .
this rests squarely on obama .
remarkable christian and american .
you all are in our prayers !
georgia deserves better than this !
now next time vote cantor for speaker instead of boehner !
rand wake up
you are an amazing person marco .
most of our government has forgotten this .
please say yes to a cr .
msnbs will never cover it because it makes obama look bad .
aiding egypt is aiding our end .
if you are compelled to see it you can at gavin seim for liberty
food stamps , welfare , etc just so they can live without working .
i only hope you have to go on obamacare yourself ..
glad to have someone fighting the fight mr. paul .
i think kevin is getting a little touchy .
may god bless you greatly for your efforts ...
impeach obama why your at it .
you lost on obamacare .
rand , we really do need a libertarian candidate .
excellent summation by mr. mcclintock !
well then you need to clean house in washington .
if they listed it as collateral then let them take it .
we have the time what we don &apos;t have is a good government .
praying for you and for our country
thanks for serving us well marsha !
that means he is in charge of the military .
i want to know why you voted not to defund egypt ! ! ! !
i can &apos;t believe you voted to send jets to known terrorist !
sorry flake you blew it
it is in direct violation of the constitution , freedom to practice religion
bush , reagan , lincoln , lbj , washington
i am praying our next president will honor these words !
mr. walden , you quit working for the little guy along time ago .
sounds to me like obama is the yankee turd .
mia you need to help fire all these idiots
# standwithrand # letranddebate
kind of a no brainer vern !
mr gowdy , the left will criticize you no matter what you do here .
vern my father was drafted in 1942. he was 25 years old .
i really like sensor mccain in most instances .
i have already posted for them to select trey gowdy as leader !
it is time to hold our government responsible .
obama was clever covering his own butt when he chose him for 2012 !
he thinks this is his kingdom and down with the constitution .
so sorry tom tillis listen to the american people trump all the way !
i like my freedoms too much not to be with the 2 / 3 .
i belive martha stout said &quot; we are all a little crazy . &quot;
my ideal is that you will be the speaker of the house .
we the people don &apos;t need more taxes or want the internet tax
boehner is spineless ... you voted for him ? ? ?
i am a south carolina voter .
first by getting rid of this rediculous common core .
praying you have a lot of support and this is the beginning !
prayers being sent to the thune family !
someone has to stand firm .
vote no on internet sales tax .
ronnie reagan .
this is in total opposition to our constitution dictates .
... if not , at least obama !
you cannot trust a word obama says .
public schools are not failing our children ; government has failed our schools .
why isn &apos;t obama being impeached ? ? ? ? ?
no amnesty period .
thank yoiu froyour dilligent work rand ! !
no tricks .
don &apos;t loose site of that cruz and lee ...
way to jump on board after he was elected .
we pray you vote no for devos !
the president is evil .
oh yea roy the boy is a punk too &gt;
congratulations bruce .
mia you would be positive of every thing !
why did you vote for boehner ?
how do we impeach him ?
sorry jerry , not believing your logic here .
honestly , i believe he is the establishment stooge .
love you mia ..... continue your fight for the conservative christians in this country .
this country has gone down the marxist sewer !
the american people expect action and not just talk .
it took 3 days to go 180. god bless america .
the congress and senate have the power of impeachment to stop him .
tried to pass the patriot act and you failed at that .
the problem is the spending .
true sen. rubio
why are the rpublicans working on repealing obamacare ?
he is an honest man who cares &amp; a true conservative !
they better start or the next election we will start sending them packing !
oh , i see , you &apos;re just spouting more conservative vs. liberal crap .
thats the problem with mccain .
he can &apos;t say that because he has no godly faith .
uh , no
this obamacare is going to be another , tax burden on hard working americans .
it is absolutely evil .
i do hope you will vote for the house-passed cr that defunds # obamacare !
how about getting rid of obama care and entitlements
all done by design sir .
and impeachable for anyone sworn to the constitution
for crying out loud override the veto .
i hate obama mr. mccain , please do something
stand with mike lee , cruz .
keep doing your job , vern .
you lost my vote you rino .
and all the illegals get full coverage .
1 ) ronald reagan - and he &apos;s dead .
amen , i do agree
i also was not happy that you voted for boehner .
we trade with russia and china both communist oppressive regimes .
blind tea party nut jobs is why utah is so backwards !
keep doing your thing rand .
we already have local control in wyoming .
we truly appreciate all you do for us congressman franks .
give em hell ... standing with rand !
treason = impeachment !
lets pray that it is a one time incident .
you are no reagan and never will be , reagan was a real american !
another one on obama payroll
as in the ronald reagan days .
great to get a libertarian in there rand !
for the sake of america , impeach trump .
a friend of ron paul is a friend of mine !
and sen. rand paul seems ok with this .
remember he amnesty thing ?
we sent republicans to washington to stand strong !
wish you and the other republican elites had realized that a long time ago
wacko bird for president ! ! !
the hell with obama , look at all obama has done to our america .
the 24 rino backstabbers who have betrayed america and subverted the constitution deserve scorn .
yeah they are tired of people like you running the government
i am ashamed he is from tn
nice english bob .
but don &apos;t ask him what he thinks of you .
ironic how obama is turning the american dream into a nightmare .
we really love you so much , trey gowdy !
many prayers mr scott
blunt as as conservative as hugo chavez .
yes .. get rid of obama and take away irs !
stay the course - you are in our prayers !
option b since the tax dollars will be used anyway .
the real patriots are tired of getting the furry end of the lolly pop .
to see you join in with mccain , graham and ayotte is amazing .
it &apos;s the only way to close the loopholes .
a repeal is foolish and irresponsible .
constitution party
oh hell no
he is going to be the fall of america !
congrat &apos;s mr. paul you deserve it .
you just proved to america sir that you are on the take .
hopefully not doctors who perform third term abortions .
o is a sham !
south carolina doesn &apos;t even want you .
obama doesn &apos;t give a flip about the laws of this country .
listen to the teachers and vote no !
never trust obama and his cohorts !
vets should always be before illegals
obama has many lavish vacations with it and so has michelle .
i am from north carolina and people like you think everything is so easy !
praying for repentance .
i say u start impeachment proceedings immediately .
obama took the $ $ from medicare to pay for his obamacare .
obama care is broken before it ever starts .
it was expected of obama .
send them back to their country now .
impeach obama for war crimes .
just lost my vote sir
step up and condemn this anti american administration !
obama just want votes !
defund obamacare , it is that simple !
careful spending and increased income will balance the budget over time .
understanding that the flag physically didn &apos;t pull the trigger .
your welcome judas paul .
i would hope that the republican establishment would take note !
present day george w bush
better late than never mr. speaker .
rand paul # 2016
praying you recover quickly .
and their blaint disregard for the constitution and the american people .
should &apos;ve kept your day job as a cut rate eye doctor .
furthermore , the epa czar has assured me that there will be little waste .
why do you not listen to your voters and stand up against this crowd .
no new spending , cut unnecessary spending and start to bring down the debt !
merry christmas mia and family
no john thune u do not speak for all south dakota &amp; especially me !
education authority back to states ?
i hardly think the epa is the root of all problems .
we will continue praying for amanda and for all of you !
he can &apos;t even secure our borders and keep our citizens safe .
i sense she would be the first to come to our aid if needed .
i mean after all they take an oath to america and the constitution .
tax rates are relatively unimportant unless spending is gotten under control .
please lindsay keep running your mouth .
please , sir , do not let them mess this up !
impeach and remove .
just read the comments about ryan that tells it all .
sets debate time for cromnibus for 80 minutes total 5 . )
fox is the only station even talking about it .
a true patriot would fight against everything the gop stands for .
boy does god have his hands in this ! ! ! !
president paul 2016 !
the republicans should start the impeachment of president obama .
i know sc needs you but the whole nation needs you now .
great work dave !
mia , pls post it on you tube ....
it doesn &apos;t matter what flag it is !
doesn &apos;t congress approve ( or cut ) the military spending of our troops ?
amen now impeach obama
israel has been our one true ally for a very long time .
we know you voted yea on the cloture vote ! !
prayers for you and your family sweet boy .
prayers for you and your little one .
i agree with your no votes
we thought the courts would kill obamacare .
johnny come lately ... ugh !
you sold those people out , sir !
you &apos;re lying on fb , jerry .
marco rubion 2016
tim you have a traitor and a muslim what do you expect ?
he will continue to disregard our constitution as usual .
shame on the rest of the republicans who ignored rand .
investigate his ties to russia and impeach him !
name one unconstitutional thing president obama has done .
you are loved marco !
seems like the congress cut funding for security .
i must admit i am an ultra conservative person .
rand , don &apos;t start skewing statistics .
includes my son nathan mike
is dismantling the constitution not terrorism ?
mr. yoho , just keep fighting the good fight .
praying for families affected .
@ mike schloss , you apparently have no clue what you are talking about .
then get on board marco and get behind our candidate !
you supported bush and now blame obama for the same things .
he needs to mind his own business .
we really need god &apos;s mercy .
time to clean house !
zero authority
hope to see you continuing to rise in your political career , congressman poe !
hence why poliquin doesn &apos;t want blaine in the debates , and cain does .
representing life , liberty &amp; the pursuit of happiness .
why hasn &apos;t impeachment proceedings been started ?
even the immortal george w. bush .
no extra constitutional laws !
of course they are only 50 % of the communist that reagan was .
tell obama he must stand down for the good of the country
it would be nice if a christian could fill the spot
and 5 million illegals would never be given everything + $ 35,000 .
ted , start impeachment for derilection of duty and providing comfort to our enemies .
amen mr. mccain
the people on the list will be republicans like the irs did .
there is a reason why many americans call cnn the communist news network .
my prayer is for you and your family .
then lindsey , you are part of the reason the american people want change .
praying now ........
our president will not stop flights into our country .
i told you so many months ago
talk talk , talk talk ....
i think rand has no idea what the hell he stands for .
renew the zadroga act permanently .
not as bad as during the bush administration
i think it &apos;s too late mia .
merry christmas with all of god &apos;s blessings to you and your family !
put a clean cr on the floor .
senator isakson is right .
it &apos;s so easy to say cut spending .
that concern was called the ron paul movement .
either instead of income , or as a portion of lowered income tax .
sticks and stones senator rand !
we need reform , but not obamacare .
i think the republican party doesn &apos;t need to be stupid .
we voted republicans in to uphold the law and hold back this unlawful president .
how many members of congress have served actively in our military ?
your homies call the shots not obama
consider the source senator rand paul .
thank u rand , i hope u &apos;ll help fight for our 2nd .
why hasn &apos;t he been impeached for treason ?
you &apos;re a spineless pussy .
federal judge has a plan to make them public ! !
obviously , boehner and reid should have already done so , senator .
cut the presidents retirement in face don &apos;t let him have any
after mccain &apos;s comments he needs to go .
pray you are up to the task .
miss you mr reagan .
what can be done to hold obama accountable ?
cut our expenses 25 % and cut out borrowing .
how about a secure border and a deportation program that functions too .
obama is not doing a tax hike !
you are anything but a &quot; wacko bird &quot; .
the truth about rinos is that rinos dont want to know about the truth !
repeal obamacare , no one wants it ! !
please put america &apos;s children before partisan politics and vote no on betsy devos .
outside of the once off stimulus obama has not initiated any new spending programs .
happy thanksgiving dear mr gowdy to you and your family .
quit wasting our taxpayer dollars on these witch hunts .
spend spend and spend .
agree , defund and shut it down .
mccain , do your job and begin the impeachment process against trump .
i &apos;m sorry mia love .
my guess is , it &apos;s an obama quote !
repeal and impeachment
it can &apos;t lost my vote and a whole lot more .
our president is a traitor to send money and weapons to al-queda .

sen. mccain , keep up the good work !
a vote for cloture is a betrayal !
stop obama and his gun grabbing cronies from taking our second amendment right .
senator collins , i think it &apos;s a good choice to support the treaty .
sir , i must disagree .
what about stopping ndaa and the patriot act ?
if his lips are moving he is lying
steve arnold loganville ga. a georgia voter .
provided it isn &apos;t actually just a stinking amnesty bill .
why is the fbi letting them off the average criminal wouldn &apos;t get off .
i pray that somewhere down the line something changes for the better .

thanks , greg
agree ... if only they would listen
tom , you are smarter than this .
warning to the gop do your job and stand your ground for the people .
congress get off your seat of do nothing and save our country from obama !
support senator rand paul to rein in the epa
marco was awesome in jacksonville .
close the borders impeach obama !
you have not been astounding in florida by any means .
well done paul .
please defund obamacare even if it results in a government shutdown .
this is clearly unconstitutional
you rino pos
just like prohibition , the newly elected conservatives can completely repeal obama care .
repeal the nfa
replace &quot; boo-hoo &quot; boehner !
you are an embarrassment to our constitution
yes we have cut spending drasticly .
vote for john boehner some more ?
trey gowdy has been such a disappointment .
dear trey gowdy , happy easter .
this president wants to be a dictator .
and stop spending whats not your &apos;s
seems you &apos;re not too far behind the likes of rubio and christie .
it is also known as a high crime and misdemeanor mr. mcclintock .
watching you right now rand .
please paul stand with the people on this !
they do hate our freedom .
arrest this guy he is continually breaking the law .
going to let us know who you &apos;ll be voting for as speaker ?
if you mean the conservative wing of the republican party i agree !
we cannot pass the cr and then hope for change in the obamacare law .
almost to little to late sir
stand strong on the lord .
very well said mia .
something like a guy named castro who fooled most people incluiding kennedy
no way will i be victimized willingly .
we stand ready to defend what we imagine the constitution to say !
immigration - lincoln co .
we need real men who will defend and uphold the constitution .
full repeal is the best option !
shut down the government if necessary , it will be demacraps fault
now if you could just talk some sense into tom cotton
carry on your hard work mr. gowdy !
i trust your opinion trey gowdy ‚ô° have a merry !
the house has definitely put forth effort !
please don &apos;t cave to the democrats .
happy thanksgiving to the trey gowdy family .
help expose the rinos for what they are rand .
mr. obama is causing chaos ...
how many u.s. troops have been killed by cuban troops compared to vietnam ?
will do sir , thanks
- ronald reagan
sir your budget once again is based on repealing obama care .
i resign !
good , the administration doesn &apos;t enforce existing laws .
this is grounds for immediate impeachment .
by the way ... keep up the good work senator scott .
this helps negate the fact you voted for the first obama stimulus package .
why wait so late mr ryan , where have you been ! ! !
please vote against diane feinsteinun control
rand , obama wants to go over the cliff .
obama and his buddies in washington are &quot; playground bullies &quot; .
is it a balanced budget with no increase in taxes ?
congressman boehner played his cards about as well as possible .
you da man , rand !
keep fighting the good fight sir
no thanks to you .. you prick ! !
law should be declared unconstitutional
rubio go away already
once again , all talk and no action .
mia campaigned as a conservative and then immediately voted for boehner .
that program was ended long before obummer came on the scene .
sen isakson , thankyou for standing up for georgians and voting no to amnesty !
certainly not rubio .
no thanks to you , paul ryan .
isn &apos;t that what our respnsible conservative politicians are suppose to be doing !
there is no congressional approval .
but then it will be too late .
as a former ffl holder i will stand with you .
don &apos;t worry about these people marsha .
i appreciate you representing the state of south carolina !
obama is impeachment proof , he knows it and behaves accordingly .
what is graham doing , seeking votes ?
unfortunately , penny , you are absolutely right .
evidently mccain is too stupid to realize that .
say impeach and say disolve the irs
yes absolutely
i will be praying .
but didn &apos;t you vote for john boehner and mitch mcconnel ?
give em hell bruce .
go paul !
our constitution can &apos;t simply be ignored .
sc tried that , you may recall .
because he thinks he and his cronies are above the law .
as in hussein obama .
i think it is obvious he wants it closed to give to cuba .
if obama was impeached he will say it is because of his race .
i &apos;m so disgusted with the republican party .
in places like china and south korea .
where castro was helping the russians put nukes 90 miles away from the usa .
you have betrayed the citizens of north carolina !
bless god america !
wow .. so we pat them on the back for doing the least possible ?
reagan &amp; daddy bush
you have the peoples welfare at the top of your list .
please get this fixed , judge poe !
i will hold you to your saying you are not voting for boehner .
i wouldn &apos;t cave in to these freaks either .
for marco it &apos;s all about kowtowing to his neo-con puppet masters .
it is isis sir !
just rid our country of this blight called obama .
impeachment ?
no deb ..... just plain no .
why dont you vote to have obama impeached ?
about time mr. ryan , you needed to step up a little sooner though .
and any way you look at it mr mccain , you underhandedly got passed .
i vote for aborting spineless politicians .
is there a reason why they are leaving washington .
our texas border and all coming in via ! !
you have disappointed many of us liberty folk for supporting romney .
the problem is government spending .
so , tell me again how the current president is abusing the executive order ?
when are you going to stop voting for debt ceiling increases and internet regulation ?
from the irs .
the little i heard on levin was same ole smoke and mirrors and blame republicans
we are being infiltrated and our quasi president is leading them in ! !
i guaran-blasted-tee you that obama is behind this .
and your working to enforce the constitution how ?
senator mccain is a real patriot - we can count on him
trying him with treason would show us that something is happening .
i have and always will vote republican and you sir should do the same .
brian , ask roy why his name isn &apos;t on this list !
trey is the best !
no more aid to egypt ! ! !
stand up for the constitution or get sent home
betsy devos will cost you my vote and many others .
the voters of north carolina will remember your votes senator burr .
stay in politics rand paul you are one good man ! !
keep up the good work and protect our constitution and 2nd amendment rights !
charleston is in my prayers
why doesn &apos;t congress do something about it ?
n arms arrest him ?
why won &apos;t you listen to your constituents ?
i stand with you rand paul
please we the american people have said no and we mean no .
create safe zones and let the enemy come get some on our terms .
agreed mr .
i do not believe marco will be reelected as a senator here in florida ...
gm no !
please do not cave in to obama &apos;s demands .
you got it mia ! ! !
he has destroyed our military and he is a joke among our allies .
good point for the congressman too - toss some of that to dhs too !
i am sending my condolences to tim scott .
as a country we must support israel .
we need to stay out of it !
they need to repeal &amp; butt out ! ! ! !
john you are the walking , talking embodiment of rino .
no betsy devos !
welcome to the socialist states of america .
too little too late vern !
right on amen
to late sir you are a traitor
bring them home and secure our borders .
mr gowdy you are my brothers in so many ways .
obama is lost and hasn &apos;t a clue what an end game is .
he seems to be in tight with the irs !
cruz and romney need to go home
president obama was elected by the american people also .
trey gowdy should get the job but i don &apos;t think he will .
no to war in syria tom .
senator paul , atta boy !
romney 1 , obama 0
keep it going marco !
hope your feeling better lou !
i am pulling for you 100 % marco !
the rest of us will do our best to vote the traitors out ...
he is not an invited speaker !
so proud to have you on my side , sen. paul !
thune sounds great ! !
he is in over his head .
the confederate flag is a piece of cloth .
any one has been better then obama
any islamic terrorist can buy a gun , no questions asked
the only place i want rice is with my beef and broccoli
the flag debate should have been after the last wake .
geez , vern .
america needs you , not just fl .
hope he does better in dc than in nc
chris christie and rubio next time .
rinos franks and mcsally will vote for mccarthy
ronald reagan 381 , bush 291 , obama 157 .
george w. bush then ronald reagan /
for the love of the constitution , clean out this corrupt govt .
that &apos;s what is wrong with gop led sen. mitch mcconnel in senate .
what about communist usa if we don &apos;t get our country back
keep us safe rand !
hope you make it and don &apos;t turn rino on us .
repeal it and replace it with what ?
sad and disgusting farce dems are trying to pull .
this must be said : sanders is the antidote to trump not clinton .
fight the good fight tammy , america is rooting for you .
why do minnesotans elect this guy ?

how on earth could you side with the tea baggers on dodd frank !
my first thought when hillary said there will be a woman president someday !

this report by warren is just more liberal bs
cannot vote hillary or bernie .
elizabeth warren is one of the few politicians i admire .
elizabeth warren , where are you getting this information ?
why did you vote yes on the gmo bill ?
there ya go , justifying riots for votes .
women &apos;s rights are way too important for such a close vote .
snyder is just another lying republican .

how do they like minnesota after this cold ?
well done betty !

al you are the best senator we have had in decades !
yes , no one needs an assault weapon .
senator wyden , please keep up the good fight .
# bernieorbust bernie sanders is our only hope .
ron wyden is a tool of monsanto .
that &apos;s why most bernie supporters didn &apos;t vote in it .
so grateful for you senator franken !
other than the comment about the kkk which i suspect this is dead on .
bernie was the best tonight hands down .
excuse me debbie you are misrepresenting this .
he was invited to attend as he worked tirelessly representing new hampshire
more than likely this will tip the vote count to president elect trump .
this includes you amy klobuchar .
so proud that you represent me
bernie is the only guy to beat him !
that &apos;s why i voted for beto
just some information on clint didier gop who is challenging patty murray .
skew , this is literally sen warren cyber bullying trump .
hillary clinton did not lose because she was a woman .
please help nancy p she &apos;s disturbed .

i am so dissapointed with the choices trump is making .
now you &apos;re ranting for attention and kosta &apos;s just an ass .
thak u senator klobuchar saludos

a vote for hillary is just a wasted vote , period .
is lots of money spent by unknown people a good thing for democracy .
time for some serious talk on mental health .
liz for pres &apos; 20 takes shape .

frederick douglass was so amazing .
i care about minnesota lakes and rivers .
the sad thing is that almost all the rural communities voted red .
what part did they strike down amy ?
i am sorry for your loss al .
it is essentially one corporatist party with two wings .
you , congresswoman are the racist and you love spreading your hate .
i don &apos;t see ms warren building another candidate up here .
elizabeth warren is acting desperate !

i support your run for the dnc chair , we need you !
look in the mirror your just like trump warren ! !
and then turned around and voted against cheaper meds from canada for big pharma
please stand with the american people when we vote for bernie sanders !
the pro gun lobby is too strong and will buy congress .
thanks representative blumenauer !
oh , so elizabeth believes the candidates are boys and girls .
it is not racist to have more black friends than hillary .
elizabeth warren hailed as a conservative ?
thank you senator gillibrand for standing up to this awful nomination .
could minnesotans start to unite ?
i &apos;m going to canada for my prescription next year .
because they don &apos;t control the senate and the white house , chris .

prince and bannon are running the country .
they need you to represent our great state at the inauguration .
thanks debbie , keep it up .
kirsten and other prominent democratic women should have vied for the nomination .
patty you are talking out of the wrong orifice
or women don &apos;t care ?
thats because frank guinta is a liar
oh yeah , hillary is the answer üò≥ üò≥ üò≥
i fear they are very vulnerable right now .
yes , i am a ny voter and your constituent .
pick and choose which women ?
you too ms. warren !
amy , please let &apos;s get these economic issues solved ! !
i would prefer to give senator byrd the benefit of the doubt .
you are the best elizabeth , keep it going .
bernie says what he knows to be right .
how sad ... elizabeth warren joins the establishment .
mental health evaluations should be done with potential gun sales .
good work , senator klobuchar !
thank you for doing what i also believe is right , betty !
and btw , your cheap shots at bernie just makes his campaign stronger ! !
of course al , you can now come out of the closet .

thanks senator warren ! !
save time , save money , save us from scott brown .
thank you for your strong support !
go team patty murray ! ! ! ! !
this is now about saving our democracy .
hillary and the word &quot; decency &quot; together is enough to make me choke .
and it not part of the demexit movement of those who supported sanders .

what &apos;s with women and sexism ! ?
2018 isn &apos;t far off , senator .
try not to forget you also serve non-white nh constituents this time .
is it not the liberal supporters who incite violence at trump events ?
a reminder that the inauguration is a ceremony for the newly elected president .
give me a break , claire .
i &apos;m a proud gun owner who is also a proud freethinker and progressive .
and a bought &amp; paid for cory booker votes against the people .
meanwhile , please support mike lapointe and donate to his campaign at mikelapointe.org.
sen. warren , i &apos;m surprised that you think trump is a conservative .
thanks so much amy !
please take out the teaparty sponsored , monsanto benefitting , king amendment .
and proud of you , elizabeth !
make it so drumpf only has one term .
pleeeeese switch to bernie sanders
peaceful transfer of power , ha where were you ?
elizabeth warren you could not be more wrong !
not procreative animals and , equally , our women to act like women .
wow ... what a reason ... vote for hillary because she has a vagina ....
wish we had someone of your ilk in canada .
thank you so very much for sharing this terrible news .
i adore you , but your team ... ugh .
thank you very much for remembering the importance of june 6th senator donnelly .
she fights hard for mental health too !
thank you for your leadership on this important issue .
elizabeth warren for vice president with hillary clinton as president ! !

you &apos;re doing things right in minnesota .... wish wisconsin could get a clue !
yeah , brian .
all because of one woman , hope she &apos;s worth it .

2020 i hope to see your name on the ballot for president !
and peaceful acquiescence to the scotus coup of 2001 was its ending .
rick please fight this .
carl , welcome to the wonderful world of discussing an issue with colleen .
al gore won the popular vote by a sizeable number .
fun fact the democratic party started the kkk .
i &apos;m proud to be a minnesotan again !
thank you cory for speaking out
just straight up say it : steve bannon is our president .
claire obviously have lost touch with reality .
why would you cast your super delegate vote to hillary clinton ?
and to you , senator warren .
michigan is working on laws to do that .
cory booker , i &apos;m disappointed .
your job , senator , is to represent the people of minnesota .
bernie needs to win ... he isn &apos;t dishonest ...
what happened to p.l.u.r - peace - love - unity - respect ?
ms warren you continue to give me hope for our government !
i &apos;m for elizabeth but it &apos;s nothing personal .
how &apos;s things looking for tester right now ?
what is equal work ?
thankyou cory booker
warren is a hypocrite .
thank you for my daughters and me !
um .. news flash , people and businesses are leaving ct in droves .
bullshit get progressive or get out of the way
tulsi you are admired by many .

i &apos;m glad you &apos;re our senator !
i agree with you claire .
you got a big wad of cash from big pharma , shame on you .
elizabeth warren a career politician .
i am right there with you amy ! !
boycott everything trump .
trump is disgraceful and it &apos;s scary how many people are voting for him .
says the man who defrauded millions through drumpf university .
you are a credit to oregon .
irony : &quot; safe &quot; drugs .
i &apos;m proud to be one of your supporters .
you are a true champion of the people , louise .
trump called her a &quot; goofus &quot; .
thank you senator klubchar
unless of course u reverse course immediately and support anything bernie puts forth .
we shouldn &apos;t vote hillary we have to vote bernie
sen. harris , will you vote no to sessions today ?
hahahaha hillary lost because russia hacked ... keep telling yourself that
an amazing 57 % of the people in boston have met mayor menino
gmo is stealing our health !
as the late jim jones said &quot; drink the kool-aid &quot; senator schumer
your state is 60 % for bernie , why ? ? ?
my dream team would be warren and sanders !
in other words , polls richie has special access to .
you &amp; coons voted against kate &apos;s law .
thank you for this post and these healing words .
thank you congresswoman doris matsui !
confirmation hearings are important , but democrats have little chance of blocking cabinet appointees .
happy thanksgiving to you , jon , and your family .
agree amy .
use it in the fight to ban these weapons and protect our police .
this is just a big payout to wall street health insurers .
al , you really should run in 2020 !
john - what voter rights are you talking about ?
we will need you now more than ever .
serve us well , earl !
i think this has more to do with mental illness than a radicalized fanatic .
and put the muslim brotherhood in charge of the dnc .
the bernie sanders supporters and the blm supporters are much more violent and aggressive !
i agree with you mr booker .
you &apos;ve got the charisma and smarts that the dnc needs in a candidate .
i will never support a corporatist or a backer of $ hillary clinton .
rick , you always do the right thing .
and ditto to marriage equality .
schumer , shut up .
i wish you a happy and successful new year !
it simply further proves you are bought and paid for by big pharma .
how much you being paid ron wyden
congratulations jerry brown our new governor !

thank you and senator murphy for your dedication to gun reform ...
too bad you couldn &apos;t convince my traitorous senator warner to do the same .
you are a huge disappointment to the millions of bernie sanders voters .

amy , i really appreciate your comments on facebook .
the electoral college elected him not the people
my sentiments exactly congressman yarmuth !
it happens when he trolls democrats facebook pages .
nancy pelosi is one of those privileged few .
because hillary is much better .
canadian - made drugs are on a par with ours and much cheaper .
presumably he is now on medication to clear his thoughts .
perfectly stated congresswoman brownley .
good afternoon congressman larsen .
interesting article on el paso history !
then we &apos;ll kick ass .
we are told that democracy shouldn &apos;t work for sanders only for hillary .
bullshit is what you preach .
there is plenty of science that disputes the safety of genetically modified food .
don &apos;t hold back , ms. warren .
yes both clinton and trump are pathetic .

elizabeth warren , we really need you and others like you now .
dear mr. booker .
sen. kamala harris !

congratulations ocean champion congresswoman chellie pingree !
senator wyden , i agree with you re : steve bannon .
congratulations , so proud you are my senator
but it should include investigating whether trump and his companion were complicit .
no virtue in silence .
i can &apos;t believe you voted against bernie &apos;s ammendment .
do bad things happen on the internet , such as piracy of copyrighted materials ?
we &apos;re with you patty !
patty deserved to win .
i urge you , with all the urgency of my being , to act .
here is another good example of the need for stronger gun control .
what can be done to hold dt and steve bannon accountable ?
trump is using the same con .
meanwhile one of hillary &apos;s top vp contenders want to deregulate banks .
and both amy and al voted against an amendment to end it !
she is just scared of her super pac not getting what they want .
you should &apos; like &apos; the congresswoman kyrsten sinema page .
i am deeply ashamed of you , jim cooper !
debbie your awesome !
your vote to block refugees makes me embarrassed to be a californian .
have a happy holiday &amp; keep up the good work !
please join elizabeth warren in taking big bankers to court .

you quote alice walker , but you answer to big pharma .
drugs from canada are highly regulated .

this is an atrocious decision rescinding 40 years ( or thereabouts ) of precedence .
hey rick larsen .

trump continues to show clearly just how dangerous he is to our democracy .
in all honesty , that is what impressed me most about hillary clinton .
if turnout is there the haters are dimished .
talk about kissing ass
rachel brevik , is bernie sanders more productive then rick larsen ?
the fodder frank bank regulations that got passed .
colleen is making crap up again .
the silver lining is that you continue to be my senator .
al you have a great future ahead , just not in the senate .

cory booker you are a leader for our times .

hillary &apos;s become more and more left as bernie gains recognition .
and that trump is unfit ?
bombed boston

corey booker is that man .
mr. pallone , thank you .

we are watching developments in wisconsin closely
elizabeth warren for president and corey booker for vp the 2020 dream team !
here in ohio its super humid .
end this senseless drug war against pot smokers .
for democratic congressmen to make such a protest is the very definition of immaturity .
but you are too stupid to know the real problem , mr. van hollen .
thank you for your past service and your service ahead .
she is actually in mn doing something , not in dc taking bribes
this lady is pathetic
jeremy munson turned growing hops into minnesota hops company !
sorry amy , i just do not see the benefit .
it is women like you patty , that give me hope .
it &apos;s unsafe and a financial drain we can not afford .
businesses have a bottom line but greed always seems to blur those lines .
paper tiger brown .
thank you u.s. senator elizabeth warren for speaking up !
go back under the bridge shelly pingree you are a disappointment !
keep fighting for bikes earl !
trump is scum , but sanders is only slightly better .

can you give me two examples of his racism , sexism and xenophobia please ?
thank you , kirsten , for bringing honesty to the senate .
so am i. go , patty , go .

you do so much for our community and we are so thankful .
the gap between the wealthy and the middle class widened greatly during that period .

chuck , do you need to find your safe room ?
bullies are bullies because the people don &apos;t fight back or resist .
we appreciate your vote , senator bennet !
thank you for standing up for common human decency and against bigotry

failing that , bernie sanders all the way .
senator , we need effective gun control .
i like how people are expecting beto o &apos;rourke to agree to defund aca .
governor gerry mander decided i live in western maryland .
the democratic party has refused every single gop offer to open the government .
those who live in glass houses .....

i &apos;m a california trucker &amp; concerned supporter of a.g. harris &amp; the d.o.t.
how about you start working on harsher consequences for criminals who harm people ?
well then honey you better be bernie &apos;s running mate ! !

very disappointed in you for your nay vote on this , senator murray .
al franken is almost as bad as bernie sanders
act accordingly al frankin !
way to use the social media , senator !
she should pull her head out of her ass before she prays !
we &apos;re not talking about importing drugs from a third world country .
bravo , senator murray !

the democratic party is ethically and morally bankrupt .
blah blah blah blah ... do you believe half the shit you spew ed ?
i am so grateful to have you as my representative .
^ supposed christians supporting killing babies and gay marriage smh .
toxic stew of hatred , read your own words !

tulsi gabbard thank you fighting for all of us ! !
wow never expected louise slaughter to quote the cato institute .
would you consider a presidential run in 2020 ?
hatred and bigotry will only set this country back hundreds of years .
you did nothing as a congresswoman and you will do nothing as a senator .
trump will crush the criminal you assholes are voting for in november ! !
same to you senator stabenow .
mahalo sen .

thanks for being an amazing role model for our young women .
very happy and proud for you !
thank you , congresswoman betty mccollum .
elizabeth for president in 2016 !
it &apos;s not as if drugs coming from canada are unsafe .
thank you for your hard work patti .
that is why washington , ms warren included , is scared of him .
just like when oregonians voted to not label gmos ?
trump won the case .
trump is right in doing this .
use the time to organize and strategize !
racism begets racism !
maybe debbie is not familiar with the unemployment numbers in michigan .
while true , hillary has her own mega list of nasty traits .
i would prefer bernie , but would settle for clinton over trump any day .
tell me , how are those gun laws working out for chicago ?
i lost all respect after you supported hillary though minnesota overwhelming voted for sanders .
thank you kind spirit !
i am proud to be able to call you my senator ! ! !
warren 2024
why do you keep pushing hillary when the majority of your constituents favor bernie ?
thank you kamala harris for standing up for right .
hillary has such a difficult road ahead .
deepest condolences to your family , friends and co-workers ...
marriage is still biblically defined as between a man and a woman .

i stand behind you 100 % debbie !
this electoral college needs to go now !
democrats need to start talking about policy , or more losing is in the future
we all know how lbj really felt about it , unfortunately .
vote for hillary clinton means vote for living in peace and stabling safe security !
now , i &apos;m proud to have voted for you .
oh grow up and put your big girl panties on warren .
i am a certified application counselor for lifecare family health &amp; dental center .
god bless you tammy !
part of the big lie from the right wing noise machine .
make sure the dnc don &apos;t fudge it up again .
they voted trump because of all the baggage hillary carries .
oh , lets not mention the western wall and the beit hamikdash .
lie much liz ?
we are very lucky to have you .
mr. booker i champion your presidency to anyone who would lend an ear .
@ gary , your comment about that uppity negro is distasteful and uncalled for .
good luck amy our vets deserve better , great cause ! !
please take opportunity to obstruct and vote against these foes of our democracy .
it &apos;s not a democracy .
trump and clinton are the best we can do ?
way to go frank .
dnc chair , i hope .
we expect you to be on the right side of humanity and history .
load of crap ... big pharma money more like it !
yes come through for 2020 cory booker for president ! !

but you and senator cantwell voted no .
i respect senator mccaskill !
happy new year u.s. senator elizabeth warren
i love al the liberals needed a snl comedy guy for a strokesman
obviously taking huge donations from wall street ...
bernie sanders has said many times that it is a rigged political election system .
happy thanksgiving to you and your family as well , senator !
just make sure you vote blue for the house and senate .
in some michigan counties the variation between men and women is amazing .
first time in our history , us demoted from full democracy to flawed democracy .
# berniesanders # feelthebern # warren2020
good for you , debbie .
so , so proud to have you represent our state !
civil and human rights are not up to the popular vote .
i &apos;m with you , amy !
amy , you &apos;re the greatest .
( sen. murray , congressional record , s.6400 , 6 / 10 / 09 )
enough with your liberal jib jab warren .
schumer for being the bigger man in spite of your colleagues and friend .
elizabeth , you &apos;re too good to sleaze into taking advantage of other issues .
not worth the vote , jackie .
the same to you and yours rick .
thank you patty murray for all your hard work !
you &apos;re a class act , debbie .
and bernie is the only candidate that sees that as a problem .
did betty read the opinion .
say hi to stuart smalley for me !
our votes are not going to go to your lying fucking bitch .
happy easter to you &amp; yours amy .
at least there will be huge science breakthrough if trump reaches the white house .
it was bernie who killed it
i proudly cast my vote , for you today , jon .
cory booker you are no hero and no inspiration .
further restricting gun ownership by law abiding citizens is not a smart move .
and for your work on gun control too .
this winter is a disaster for minnesota and surrounding states !
happy new year to you 2 madam
i think you will find the voters in minnesota will be voting against you .
typical left wing loon
good job amy !
as a daughter of two immigrants i resent mr. trump very much .
i &apos;m voting for rick crimes and darryl dixon .
debbie debbie debbie .
the democratic party in ct needs to be overthrown by common sense conservatives .
like your ass head

drugs prices must be negotiable ; this provision is insane .
good job , al and all who stepped up to the plate for equality !
good luck senator kaine !

r.i.p , to the progressive in the room .
wherever there &apos;s a way for unscrupulous people to scam that shall be done .
great that senator feinstein wants to reinstate the assault weapons ban .
amy is always good for a laugh .
i think we will go down the tube if drumpf is elected president .
hope your acts haunt you !
a great comedian is gone .
you cannot vote or protest your way out of a fascist oligarchy .
more that unity and peace , we need to ban assault weapons .
how is nightly looting and molotov cocktails peaceful protests ?
they &apos;re elected to govern just like you , al .
hey liz warren , your stupid president quit doing job .
patty partisans , don &apos;t stoop to conquer .
yes to canadian drugs .
i don &apos;t understand why you aren &apos;t down with bernie , al .
vote for brian !
i was a delegate and we all need to get together .
this is why the electoral college is necessary .
bernie sanders has already said he &apos;ll support her if she wins the nomination .
please vote to oppose each of trump &apos;s cabinet picks .
happy holly holidays !
let &apos;s celebrate the first death camp in nazi germany too .
rights , love and compassion for all kentuckians .
who is holding the democratic party accountable ?
please start by eliminating the electoral college .
i urge you to pledge your super delegates to him .
point the finger directly at public union employees .
i &apos;m a progressive but it &apos;s getting outta hand and crazy .
elizabeth warren please don &apos;t forget about ted cruz
how cute ... a liberal politician calling trump names ... typical
elizabeth warren won &apos;t support anyone until after the primary .... weak ...

please avoid animal testing !
thank you senator klobuchar for your ongoing strong leadership .
this is the liz warren nation .
you &apos;re the greatest amy !
thanks senator brian schatz
kind of a hateful rant yourself .
democrats are terrified that trump is going to succeed .
your arguments ring hollow considering the amount of money you took from big pharma .
return the pharmacy money you have accepted and do the right thing .
how come this thread lost the individual reply button after tammy case ?
they don &apos;t have the votes you dumb ass
california like maryland has some of the strongest gun laws in the county !
the bombing will only worsen the problem , and increase hatred .
even bernie is .
cc patty murray
thank god we have you and bernie watching out for us !
you piece of shit
how do you respond to such inane comments as trump continues to spout ?
didn &apos;t you learn anything elizabeth .

nancy , speaking of trolls , what bridge do you live under ?
thank you , mr yarmuth , for listening to the voices of your constituents .
ty tammy
it &apos;s a proven institution of bigotry and hate .
hope you will be boycotting the inauguration ceremonies .

why won &apos;t you be our president mr. glorious corey booker !
if only hastings had the same compassion for humans as he does for dogs .......

trump supporters insult because they have nothing to show or defend .
thanks for your concern about the environment
i am extremely concerned that hillary could lose .
most of the medically bankrupt were solidly middle class before financial disaster hit . &quot;
why did you vote against getting prescriptions from canada at a much lower cost ?
you must fight and resist at every turn this evil gop fascism .
it &apos;s a sad day to me in minnesota .
a big thank you for your service from missouri tammy .
democrats do not fight hard enough .
you reid and schumer should be ashamed .

both bacterial infections resist antibiotics .
thank you congressman perlmutter for your consistent support and compassion as our representative .
thank you for all you do for the farmers .
bernie on a green ticket is a trump presidency .
most importantly i wish you and your family the gift of good health !

you should have run , senator warren .
hi there mr. pallone wonderful that we have you on our side ! !
kristen we need gun control please .

time for the democratic party to start listening to those who elected you .
i wonder if the dnc is thinking about this .
bernie cheated !
glad you &apos;re mine patty !
congrats minnesota .
this no longer a matter of political partisanship , our democracy is at stake .
mental illness is the root of this issue .
bernie wins it hands down .
this program provides health care needs to women and families .
i blame the dnc and the pick of &quot; her &quot; .
thank you elizabeth warren you are a class act and make us proud .
nevertheless , these tragedies are too frequent and many times do involve assault weapons .
shocking that keith ellison who must understand persecution and bigotry now condemns bds .
i loved senator inouye .
all the trump supporters commenting went so quick to violence .
i respect you a lot corey booker but please reject big pharma influence .
this is exactly why we have an ass hat for president .
ass !
yeah , women senators
go bernie ! !
you should choose to boycott the inauguration .
senator brown i haven &apos;t seen you post anything about gmo labeling .
claire sucks .
i live in michigan and it is an easy drive to windsor .
as a independent i now know that bernie is right our system is corrupt !
senator klobuchar - these are the exact words we need .
failed at hatred towards president trump .
&quot; he incites supporters to violence . &quot;
after 13 years of fighting , let &apos;s hope peace is near .
like your midnight vote against bernie sanders lower prescription drugs amendment ?
so lame kamala harris .
could it be the $ 267k big pharma collar around your neck puppy ?
you too , senator !
hilary is just as bad .
you sound like bernie sanders !

we just got trump and we &apos;re mad as hell .
the democratic party is too far gone to be saved .
i think she spoke from her heart without hesitating and stretching the issues .
senator chuck schumer - where are you guys ?
i am proud to say i am a veteran for sherrod brown !
hey frank , it beats being &quot; sold out &quot; .

is that a bernie endorsement ?
thank you congresswoman slaughter !
please don &apos;t attend the inauguration , patty murray !
hillary could have called died-in-the-wool trump supporters things much worse than &quot; deplorable &quot; .
trump got more votes in indiana yesterday than both bernie and hillary combined .

thank you so much for all your hard work for our veterans .
incredible progress is being made !
no waiting as schumer wants to do .
it &apos;s going to take more funding for al to continue this fight .
thank you betty !
voting for someone because of their race makes you racist .
someone has to do something about drug companies
ayers participated in acts of violence against property , property that had symbolic value .
thank you ms warren
all violence is the extreme disrespect for the rights of another .
trump &apos;s running a scam and it &apos;s working .
someone is talking as if they will be bernie &apos;s vp .
it was hillary &apos;s &quot; secret &quot; world that lost her the election .
go senator jeff !
please block his cabinet picks also .
earl , maybe you can do something about the gun shows and easy access .
that &apos;s * my * congresswoman !
go back to your reservation liz
cory booker the fake progressive .
he sounds like an instigator of hatred , disaster and terrorism -- connie
tell it like it is mr booker !
thank you , leaders !
senator murray , keep fighting for what is right .
i am am irish catholic and just want peace and a steady paycheck
amen to that elizabeth warren !
it &apos;s not fair cory !
elizabeth warren rocks !
i like her the way she is , she is for women &apos;s rights .
hopefully bernie can steal the democratic nomination from hillary .
the unnecessary and outdated electoral college ? ? ?
thank you congresswoman jackie speier , congressman bruce braley , and congressman patrick meehan .
facebook is not letting me share any of bernie sanders or elizabeth warren &apos;s posts
i know you &apos;re intelligent and progressive too .
polls show him doing better than hrc against trump in the general .
hey uneducated liberal dumb asses it &apos;s not the worst mass shooting in american history
lizzy lies .
bernie or hilary can beat him but may struggle with others .
hillary for president , elizabeth warren for vice president , an unbeatable ticket .
i wish elizabeth warren were running for president .
thank you for your years of fighting .
fuck the supreme nazi court .
keep fighting betty .
bullshit .
thanks amy you &apos;ve been an angel trying to help mn .
pepsi commercial - i loved the message !

i would appreciate it if you supported sanders sponsored bills .
safe travels home tulsi \ , , , /
it would be wise if you attended the inauguration .
the democratic party sucks and everyone knowns it .
liz here will be investigated once hes in office .
how can scott brown claim to be independent if he votes republican ?
warren won her second debate !
paul and sheila would be very proud senator and so am i .
get it done , amy ! !
ms. warren , you have always been clear in your national analysis .
thank you for questioning her .
can you talk some superdelegates into siding with bernie sanders ?
colleen - are you really that ignorant about how news organizations work ?
it was bernie supporters rioting and assaulting trump supporters in california .
and then she voted against big pharma .
mark pocan you &apos;re an asshole
please be honest with the citizens of minnesota .
that &apos;s whats up al franken
sounds like the big pharmaceutical companies .
arizona is lucky to have you .

chucks right shes a cancer to society
elizabeth warren is a certified lunatic ! !
thank you , senator murray for keeping us informed .
please senator gillibrand , i voted for you .
or charges 2000 % more than they should for prescription drugs .
protests are needed now more than ever .
other than the fact the kkk has issued statements saying they support hillary üôÉ
many , many thanks , senator gillibrand !
but why did you vote against gmo labeling ?
sanders has a better chance of beating trump .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ dear lawmaker you must stop corporate inversion .

i love jon stewart ! !
that isn &apos;t gun ownership ... that &apos;s gun addiction .
time for you to go brown !

clinton is potentially more dangerous than trump for the progressive agenda .
i am very happy to have sherrod brown as my senator .
mrs.murray , please do not attend this clowns freakshow .
amen sen. booker i say bring it ‚úä üèª
i do not understand your unilateral yes vote for trumps dangerous appointees .

we are so lucky to have you !
dear honorable congresswoman judy chu , you are awesome .
the # bernieorbust movement is huge and growing .
typical because in illinois it &apos;s chicago and that &apos;s it !
trump is an airhead .
i appreciate your explanation as i was pretty disturbed initially .
thank you amy for wholeheartedly supporting this .
thank you for your leadership on this !
brown will lose .
their strength through pain and adversity are an inspiration to us all .
trump &apos;s boeing 757 is worth more than senator warren &apos;s whole monkey family

happy winter solstice and happy new year !
she could choose ew as her vp .
thank you so much senator van hollen .
they , even cnn was all over the lloyd story .

that &apos;s really cool amy .
bernie sanders had our hearts &amp; minds &amp; enthusiasm .
really , i could care less whether you boycott the inauguration or not .
very sad that you voted for big pharma .
equality should not be up for a popularity contest vote by the people .
thank you for your work , earl .
i wonder if this woman realizes how naive she sounded today ?
run for president warren ! !
you are truly missed .
thank you senator gillibrand , et al .
how dare you compare jewish settlers in israel to termites ! ! ? ?

rip &amp; thank you for your service to our great state .
peter welch---i hope you are not attending the inauguration ?
the psychos are going to be surrounding you , tammy .

cookies in usa more delicious than thai produce .
amy &apos;s awesome , many congratulations to her : )
whenever you want to run for president , amy .
thank you for your courageous decision !
i am one who voted for trump for a multiple of reasons .
absolutely right , rep yarmuth
why are drumpf supporters on here defending that vile creature on this post .
advocating violence against peaceful rally goers is what this country has come to .
goofy ass pocahontas .
merry christmas al to you and your family : )
we need to be protected from price gouging big pharma .
and assault weapons ban !
you &apos;re doing a great job brian - thank you for posting .

minnesota is lucky to have you ... along with the rest of the country .
the electoral college is a rigged system .
it is your duty to attend .
ms. klobuchar , i am a conservative .
you and the corporate dems gave us trump .
i couldn &apos;t have said it better , senator schumer !
the electors themselves may want to do more .
a good win for michigan
more than 120,000 innocent civilians have died due to his shelling and bombing .
love trump &apos;s hate .
thank you for your amazing service to families .
thank you for all that you have done for equality !
please endorse bernie sanders-a true progressive !
and you go , girl !
jon is in network called &quot; comedy central &quot; , yes ?
it is not about you ; it is about the peaceful transition of power .
bannon is a very dsheartening sign .
i &apos;m so proud to be a minnesotan !
but hillary is a better option ?
chuck schumer you &apos;re fired .
throw your hat in the ring with bernie .
kamala harris , can you say &quot; class action lawsuit &quot; ?
can always tell the trump supporters by the language they use .
seriously , i &apos;ll take your seat at the inauguration .
hold fast , kirsten !
maria guzman nieves
you &apos;re so wrong , mr. schumer .
rose colored glasses , senator - but the thought counts .
so you punching a student is not violence .
so you endorse corporations having the power to sue countries ?
this is why we love you debbie !
so happy to have you as our senator !
there is a reason why the young generation is strongly supporting bernie .
trump but hillary has kkk supporters as well
now , about cops executing dogs ? ? ? ?
go patty go ! !
you think trumps big wall is free ?
elizabeth warren for u.s.
warren is absolutely right , and the reason gov .
i will not vote for udall
love you louise .

thank you , senator kirstin kirsten gillibrand , , ,
it &apos;s way over do sherrod we need to ban bombs !
elizabeth is the best thing to happen to washington in a long time !
can &apos;t believe you sided with big pharma .
why can &apos;t we change the electoral college system ?
sounds like you are a bernie supporter !
we progressives are still fighting .
her hate-filled rants lead me to believe that she needs mental health help .
love you , elizabeth warren !
you &apos;ll find answers , too , earl blumenauer .
cory booker , why do you take their money ?
isn &apos;t our electoral vote already committed to trump ?
keep up the great work rick .
thank you senators stabenow and levin .
i know that senator merkley will also be voting no .
thank you los angeles times for her as your choice !
cory , you &apos;re full of shit .
perhaps it is you , dutch , who is &apos; ill informed &apos; .
i &apos;m hoping you do , too , senator michael bennet .
keith ellison you sir are an embarrassment to minnesota and the democratic process .
overwhelmingly supportive constituents are voting yes for warren !
we need a cheaper safer solution .
thank you for your efforts on behalf of minnesotans--and all americans .
bernie sanders or jill stein
the electoral college needs to go .
you shine like a beacon for all us ...
this is a win-win for all of us &lt; 3
warren 2012 !
this is just another reason why i love you senator warren !
mr cleaver i am confused .
brown used poor taste with his disparaging remarks about the attractiveness of elizabeth warren .
we elected trump to drain that , senator .

wish you would run , elizabeth !
i am sorry you have also become a shill for corporate oil .
so thrilled for you , senator .
peter you are appreciated !
is this simply gun violence or something more dangerous , like jihadi violence ?
it doesn &apos;t surprise me that so many bernie guys are trump supporters .
is this correct rick larson ?
congressman brad sherman has been spamming my email for years .
knock off your divisive bullshit already !
john lewis is a liar .
you had better stay in oregon .

al franken is an assault weapon !
happy thanksgiving nancy pelosi
how well stated , elizabeth !
not because you want a cabinet position .
that &apos;s the interesting thing about democracy .
gun violence is caused by the presence of violent people .
you will be an excellent congresswoman .
please cory booker do right .
it can &apos;t be easy to be a principled politician , cory .
thank you congresswoman for leading on this very important issue !

trump 2016 in a landslide .
now we are at the mercy of us drug companies only interested in profits .
riot geared police create riots .
earl , you rock !
thank you senator merkley for your kind words
please , withhold and abstain from confirming any further cabinet nominees
cory booker this will forever be used against you .
he was a great comic and funny actor and a man of true talent .

i love elizabeth warren because she is not afraid .
thank you , congresswoman julia brownley !
you serve nj proudly .
grow up people , she &apos;s a senator for massachusetts .
mr. booker right now my hopes have been crushed with this presidential election .
mental health and terrorism should top your list .
bannon is below scum , and i am more than disgusted with this appointment .
: ) # feelthebern
atta a gal amy !
elizabeth ... you rock !
i pray for peaceful ramadan around the world .
i know you will fight like hell for what is right , tammy !
then go back up sanders .
h.r.4269 - assault weapons ban of 2015 is an abomination .
you rock , senator franken !
you go , earl !
now they maintain slavery by keeping minorities on the public resource drug addiction .
screw u al franken thats why this country going to hell
keep fighting ron !
so is that why you didn &apos;t challenge the electoral college results ?
the democrats are controlled by corporate interests ? ? ?
sanders / warren sounds like a great ticker !

bernie is the only candidate who can beat trump .
you are a wonderful advocate for women in ny and around the country .
include faster immigrant processing as part of # cir # movefwd
this is not the greatest democracy .
lol wow you &apos;re very ignorant
thank you senator wyden for standing against the trump picks for heads of goverment .
to paraphrase frank sinatra , &quot; you want it your way &quot; .
and we &apos;d like you to abandon your divisive rhetoric as well .
and put an end to trapping and use of dogs to harass wolves .
* huge fucking eyeroll *
i always liked you frank pallone .
elizabeth warren i voted for hillary .
thanks congressman thompson
i love her and i &apos;d vote for her for president in a heartbeat .

the people voted bernie , you need to , too ! !
thanks , dick , for betraying us with the gmo labeling bill .
booker , you &apos;ve become a joke now .
the disappointing thing about this is hilary won the popular vote

kudos patty for being strong enough to not attempt to silence the conversation .
don &apos;t take pharma money ! !
you and every single super delegate and hrc supporter .

apparently elizabeth isn &apos;t getting enough attention .
i don &apos;t like trump but hillary is not the answer
remind me again why elizabeth warren is not running for president .
thank you senator wyden for your strength .
it is a symbol of heritage and bravery not of racism , and hate .
thank you for being a champion for the little people !
thanks amy .
why doesn &apos;t she warn us about elizabeth warren ?
thank you , senator brown for everything you do !
stop trying to win votes claire .
how sweet and happy anniversary al &amp; fran !
i hope you help the residents of new york even more !

please protect higher education , trio and pell grants
senator kaine not paying 1400 a month with a 14k deductible on obamacare
are you reading this , frank ?
oh al shut up .
pretty sure women work less because they sit around , have kids more often .
president obama will speak at president warren &apos;s inauguration .
mental illness is hard to understand .
notice that the typical blue states of wisconsin and pennsylvania went red this time .
fake tears schumer .
or about mental health issues , and the lack of available help .
thank you senator warner ! !
warren won &apos;t give any credit for the good things he is saying .
this women is insane .
then educate yourself on these so called assault rifles .
treatments and medications are being slashed .
all because you clowns backed hillary
god bless you - i &apos;m glad you represent the great state of minnesota .
donald trump is very , very dangerous
so ... bernie sanders ... heard his name ... ?
v / r ed
rip , senator !
the shocking silence of the republicans is outrageous .
i &apos;m right there with you debbie stabenow !
i love it because senator warren gets under donalds thin-skinned
mike lapointe you say ?
it &apos;s the hypocrisy of hobby lobby that bothers me .
thank you , dr. warren !
please keep speaking out , elizabeth warren .
tells us alot about pallone eh ?
bravo for speaking up rep. lloyd doggett !
you screwed up booker .
well said joe ... it &apos;s discrimination really ?
how about pledging to no longer accept big pharma money ?
instead of taxing me on what i buy just in mn .
trump is a threat to democracy and his cabinet picks are an abomination .
keep up the good fight mr. booker .
congratulations senator franken , looking forward to seeing you seated .
he never encouraged violence and hate amongst his supporters , at his rallies .
thank you patty for all you do to help enrichen the lives of everyone !
merry christmas jon !
you claim to fight for affordable health care yet voted against half-price prescription medication .
the only protesters placing hands on anyone are bernie sanders supporters !
hope you become hillary clinton running mate .
# neverclinton ---when will you endorse bernie sanders ? -----
i actually believe that our economy suffers from corporate greed .
sooooo ... you &apos;re supporting school choice , frank ?
elizabeth you must join michelle obama and run in 2020 .
hey rick !
thank you , senator ron wyden .
this woman should not be confirmed .
thank you for your service , kirsten .
how is trump an illegitimate president as people keep posting on here ?

all the more reason to push harder for a public option .
nurses for sherrod brown ! !

god bless you tammy duckworth ..... the young &apos;s in san carlos ca ...
i thought she said she wasn &apos;t going to play the woman card ..
keep on working , kamala .
tulsi , i would like you to leave the party with bernie and us .
tell your fellow democratic senators and president to negotiate .
i am college educated and work hard for what i do .
you see why no one takes you progressives seriously .
i &apos;m in tears from a full heart and hope .
or ... maybe brian , you should run !
not proud right now of mn at all ... disqusted !
congratulations to you senator !
love and unity trumps fear and hate .
thank you for the fine words , congresswoman .

thank u senator warner
elizabeth warren spewing lies and hatred for our next president , donald trump .
not if she passes the tpp
i support you 100 % louise slaughter .
elizabeth , i respected you so much .
many comments hear about the cost and safety of drugs in canada .
an awful lot of drug and alcohol treatment happens in prisons .
it &apos;s so sad &amp; scary for sure ! !
which is why we do desperately need bernie .
and again i say , thank you senator shaheen !
tim kaine we love ‚ù§ Ô∏è you ! ! !
go get them claire !
voting blue !
senator merkley , i am disappointed in you .

please visit us at the volunteers in medicine berkshires clinic in great barrington .
beloit , wisconsin
this will be the same hateful rhetoric that will continue after he becomes president .
its never the guns as the nra says .
sadly you peaked while selling newark residents out .
booker in 2020. who else is with me ?
this sounds like james garner was grooming elizabeth warren like a pedophile .
headline reads : elizabeth warren makes profit by buying and selling homes !
none of that will happen under the new fascist regime .
thank you , sen gillibrand !
could you please explain your stand on those pharmaceutical drugs ?
amy , i will correct you .
than you , al .
senator murray , i owe you an apology .

dear debbie , you know of course notre dame beat u s c 41-31 !
elizabeth , please shut up and go take your medicine .
tammy your my hero
even a misogynist like me knows you &apos;re a bad ass .
bet you would have had an easier time working with bernie than the donald .
no educated intelligent individual could rationalize trump as a leader .
much respect to you congressman bill pascrell , jr. but i wholeheartedly disagree .
tammy 2016

how could you vote against cheaper prescription drugs from canada ?
bernie or bust , senator .
minnesota wants bernie .
you got it right joe , just convince the others !
but so do holyoke catholic and st. mary &apos;s .
senator warren has no credibility .
cory took the money !
you do rock !
patty murray , the time to act is now !
wonderful story , thank you for your intercession and hard work .
&lt; 3 booker 2020 &lt; 3
hillary has committed serious crimes .
crooked hillary ?

thank you mr. welch for your support .
praising frankie 24 / 7 is tough work
bring back funding to mental health .

minnesota has always been a leader in efforts to increase voting opportunities for citizens .
we live you in nh and the usa ! ! !
cory , do not capitulate with the republicans .
mahalo nui loa , senator brian schatz !
keith miller your comment was totally unnecessary and rude .
rep. cheri bustos
favoring corporations and the rich .
working to re-elect patty was the labor of love .
thank you for posting congresswoman eshoo .
rossi is a dickhead who doesn &apos;t like women very much .
barbara you not going only to the inauguration only shows how ignorant you are .
fracking causes earthquakes and sink holes .
it &apos;s the unrelenting liberalism which appalls many outside of the metro nyc area .
afterwards , i did additional research with regard to ms. warren .
the world needs more women role models like you !
we need women and men of modest backgrounds running for office at every level .
so who , ms. warren , is the real alternative ?
al , loved you and stuart smally on the snl reunion last night !
cmon ms. warren , save america .
i &apos;m with her , vote for hillary
you &apos;re the best rep. duckworth .
thank you for all your advocacy on this bill .
help us debbie !
she represents all tax payers of michigan equally .
much love from st. louis .

congressman steve cohen thanks for nominating ron walter &apos;s .
trade deals that screw workers are not progressive .
cory booker you are a good man .. thanks for fighting the good fight .
bs , don &apos;t take pharma pac money and you will be more convincing .
you both lost me at racists and ignorance .
üíï you are a beacon of hope .
maybe your definition of racism is a bit different .
well said , rep. doggett .
thank you congresswoman , for all of your hard work and dedication .
peter - you rock !
thank you for your effort amy .
carter temporarily banned iranians .

this is why your democratic colleagues have been voted out .
i wanted to say : thanks !
they might give you some help.thanks amy for all your great work !
but it &apos;s a bad start to 4 years of resistance .
no , ms. warren , the american people have had enough .
barbara beardsworth shpritz

i cry too chuck , every time a baby is aborted in this country .
i do not like this woman .
happy thanksgiving to you and your family , elizabeth ! ! !

you are not representing minnesotans by voting with the harry reid .

and to you mrs elizabeth warren give them hell senator happy bnew year
still mourning that loss , but you are right , amy .
iam a union worker , i collected my last eui check yesterday .
anyone who thinks elizabeth warren is part of the problem is a republican troll .
the police do not deserve a peaceful protest they haven &apos;t allowed for it .

women work very hard most times more than men .
gillibrand , you &apos;re a damned moron
senator warren , you &apos;re great .
rick blaine : i was misinformed .
hillary and elizabeth are going to show trump the way .

i &apos;m staying in bernie &apos;s lane .
bernie won your state , you should support him .
that &apos;s been tailored to the audience to get maximum reaction .
what &apos;s your solution to transition to renewable energy ?
people want more power than corporate &quot; super delegates &quot; .

be true to your constituents and cast your super delegate vote for him .
he doesn &apos;t call former klan leaders &quot; great mentors &quot; like hillary .
agreed but voting for big pharma is not activism .
yes , because looting and burning businesses are peaceful protests .
i won &apos;t be attending donald trump &apos;s inauguration . &quot;
you too ms. gillibrand .
we also welcome the bernie independents and the bernie republicans ! ! !

i repeat , cory booker is a republican
you are always working for the people , senator .
the momentum was with bernie .
gillibrand for president 2020 !
if senator sanders wins the popular vote then he should have your delegate vote .
you used to be a hero of the progressive cause .
like you &apos;re falling into line by backing hillary ?
trump is the devil incarnate - don &apos;t be fooled .
i also would like to see more drugs become generic sooner
americans and democracy are more important right now ! !
please work to have this reversed , senator .
i wish hrc would join you !
bernie would have won ..

bernie must be included ....

thank you for your commitment to our children !
folks we don &apos;t have a democracy .
they are being assaulted by militarized police with nesr lethal tactics .
hillary belongs in a jail cell and trump is a narcissistic nut job .
these warriors deserve all the medically and mental help they can get .
we got screwed again by the archaic electoral college .
