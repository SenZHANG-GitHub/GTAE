mr. jason chaffetz i am so very disappointed in your statement of today .
you &apos;re never going to please everyone all the time rand .
i don &apos;t see how anyone wins if we go over the fiscal cliff .
the irs has to answer for their complicity in the administration &apos;s shenanigans .
then cut out all your needless travaling .
we might do better with no party but that won &apos;t work either .
fund obamacare - people are hurting - alot of them in alabama .
are you ready to replace mitch .
just stop mccain , you are no longer relevant ! 😔
jesus christ is risen today ! ! !
pass an immigration bill and the president won &apos;t have to act .
you will regret what you are doing to the republican party .
god bless you sir .....
tom they couldnt use that much ammo in 10 years ! ! !
google obama debt train and be afraid &#91; &#91; photo &#93; &#93;

thanks for fighting for us brother !
good job sen rubio
senator tim scott needs our support .
you heard of the new virus which is rampant in south and central america .
you are looking better and better as a presidential nominee for 2016 .
cr must not fund govt past the end of the year .
so marco rubio .... why didn &apos;t you run ?
it goes deep and the irs needs to go
the obamacare fiasco is unconstitutional .
cruz .
are you like senator cruz running for president ?
we know them by their proper names , texas and florida .
cut the spending , freez the debt ceiling no new or expanded taxes !
gee could it be that obama is giving to his birth nations ?
so- its time for you to run for speaker .
looks to me like we are getting deficit spending under control .
obama is crazy ! ! ! !
and tim , afraid you are wrong .
how can you remove a states flag .
it is why we sent you to washington .
our billions in aid gives them a better standard of living than us .
keep the federal government ... or maybe we should keep you out of federal government
senator isakson , what are you doing about impeaching obama ?
let obama be the impediment .
i &apos;m not sure cuba has to agree with anything .
no deductions for anyone .
elections have consequences and voting for boehner has even more .
close friends have a son who is serving as a border patrol agent .
emily who ? ? ? ? ? ? ?
he appears convinced that the economy depends on the government injecting money into it .
ted is just another obstructionist !
obama won &apos;t give in unless he gets out !
then the patriot act and the dhs .
what do you plan to do about it mr. senator ?
i sure hope you stand with ted cruz and mike lee .
i think mr. veto needs a visit by mr .
we will keep you in our prayers !
could we see to it that holder does 15 - 20 behind bars ?
i hoped you would be the senator that would actually listen to your constituents .
i solute you , sir !
not enough , mccain .
you may not agree with obama &apos;s policies , but they are constitutional .
michael b james .
if chris christie can sell his soul because of reelection or possible president candidate .
stop talking and do something about it .
devos has no idea what is best for our education system or our kids .
mitch you are a scholar and a gentlemen .
got your back on that one lou !
he is putting everyone at risk and he needs to be stopped .
but obama want to a start war .
time for you to step up senator lankford .
everyone in that republican house needs to go today ..
congressman lamborn , your facebook is a great idea .
heading out now- voting for mitch !
we need to hold obama accountable and impeach him .
sounds like &quot; too little too late &quot; ryan .
saudi arabia is doing the same thing they are all the same
i &apos;d love to hear you defend your support for rino lamar alexander .
go , dr paul ! !
no nukes .
tim my prayers are with you and ur family
you are becoming the rino moron i &apos;ve suspected you to be all along .

paul ryan you are pathetic ! ! ! ! !
both conservatives and liberals are guilty .
clinton was impeached .

we all need to start praying for a different kind of world .
he has the number one spot in the earlier debate .
better late than never ! !
i agree no more debt !
marco rubio , we can &apos;t afford to have trump either .
reagan and any conservative that takes out hillary .
don &apos;t cave on funding for obama &apos;s amnesty !
this is the question nobody close to the wh is answering .
we voted you into office to stop this dictator .
mr. rand paul , just consider the source .
if you &apos;re a wacko bird then so am i !
socialism has never worked anywhere it has been tried ... kill it !
lindsey graham , the hon .
obama is badnews when are people gonna get it
adding those words to the pledge had no impact on communist countries .
force john behner to allow the investigation into benghazi or send him packing .
praying for you and your family as you head to south carolina .
just another way obama &apos;s policies are killing america .
mcclintock wants to save small businesses too , do you think our pres .
you know if obama is for something it is bad for americans
glad you know what you should be doing vern .
devos is not qualified , plain and simple .
senator thune , i am spreading your word though email and voice .
a little late to the party buddy
god bless you and the treasured brothers and sisters you serve , erik hesse
you are shutting down the government !
i bet you voted for slick willie didn &apos;t ya tim .
finally someone is standing up to this administration .
* * seems to eliminate ted cruz from consideration .
chris christie is no longer a conservative .
yet , they ran on the premise to defund the law and cut spending .
i am so thankful that amanda is home !
confirm betsy devos
the republican party was once respectable and educated .
happy fathers day to you , mr. gowdy !

it took a republican president to end it .
i absolutely oppose this as well as the funding either side .
rand paul has my vote !
you sir are an americian gem god bless veterans
mr. paul make sure we have their backs too .
we can &apos;t afford to sell out to obama and harry reid .
vote no on devos and vote to end crony capitalism .
stand behind your party sasse ! !
wish rand was twins of eventrips
i still think trey gowdy would have made a great speaker .
ron paul will never compromise , he will defend &amp; protect the 2nd amenment .
mc cain is a war monger , a disgrace .....
there is an obvious reason why obama would do this ...
cuba has more to gain from us than russia does ! !
my family wants secure borders , and all the illegals in prison deported .
this guy came from a good blood line , his father had some strong sprinters
she is grossly unqualified for the office .
blessings to amanda and all of the family .
vote no for devos and at least support someone who understands education .
you are the problem , sir .
give us the truth mr. gowdy !
mike , i don &apos;t trust the concress .
you got it right jerry , pay down the debt !
sick and tired of non - americans wanting to run our country .
you and the entire republican party are a disgrace to all americans ! !
raise the ceiling , then try to debate the budget .
good work congressman jason chaffetz
priority ... getting rid of obama and his administration .
please vote against boehner as speaker in january .
we need more republicans in both houses in 2014
i managed to balance it with no tax increase - can you ?
hopefully the people of az will recall you and traitor mccain over this travesty .
you sir , are a traitor to the republician party .
america is going to need a whole lot more than praying .
but goodonya mike !
they won &apos;t fool us mr .
there were plenty of people who hated president reagan but he was my favorite !
how about tightening up our borders and get all illegals out of our country .

john mccain is the republican benedict arnold
congress has the check book and don &apos;t write a blank check for obamacare .
i think cnn is trying to make a mockery out of our elections ! !
most doctors are retiring , and the other ones won &apos;t accept obamacare .
praying for egypt
we need to make a list of all who cave into obamas bully tactics .
attack on a us embassy and our president thinks we should stand down .

act like the majority that the american people have elected to congress .
you got my vote today , johnny .
un , somebody needs to step up .
a true conservative that deserves this award would support term limits !
many are rightly concerned with the disarray our current administration is in .
charlie crist must be stopped .
all else hinges on our constitution .
the wacko birds are currently nesting in the white house .
not one is asking you to vote &quot; yes &quot; for cloture .
we are watching you , johnny isakson !
the conservatives sold out the republican party ........
they want an establishment republican which you are not .
once again ryan not true .
mr. thune run for president !
he was put in by the bush cabal and you know it !
what another great day for sc .
god bless obama
lets talk about the carve out for obamacare .
the left needs to go up and put a stop to dividing our country .
you have no common sense do you ?
( cain supporters )
the house is at last starting the impeachment process .
i guess it &apos;s a victory for wyoming .
weak tim .
everyone who keeps on saying senator john mccain voted for tarp and etc .
cut federal taxes !
there &apos;s the latest term for not enforcing current law regarding illegals .
the only ones worth a flip are cruz , carson , paul and walker .
i support rand paul for this reason .
americans pay too much tax .
you sold your principles and beliefs for prosperity .
no man left behind .
reagan today would be classified as a liberal socialist .
may god bless and keep you safe
good luck with that rand with this govt that will never happen ...
quit wasting my taxes .
no need for either of you to even be making a statement .
war is big business , and mitt wants it .
he needs more vacation money
when are articles of impeachment going to be drawn up ?
what about impeachment and prosecution ?
ok tom so how about we get answeres that what you are ther for ?
tom , i think your ugh ... on the wrong page ! ! !
hopefully fox news will be able to find egypt on a map this time .
it will cause you to loose support from conservatives like me .

the national debt is priority number 1
stay the course , mr .

no amnesty mr. burr ......
bruce , you keep going , you &apos;re doing a good job .
the government wants to abolish our founding principles .
cruz or christie for attorney general !
phil bryant for governor in 2011 , and gregg harper for senate in 2014 .
hey sasse , what have you accomplished the last two years in dc ?
so that loyalty pledge you signed just goes right out the window huh ?
anything trey says is good with me !
communist jackazzes dont build up they tear down !
our new republican leadership has already taken it off the table ( cowards ) .
imagine what he could have done if the establishment had gotten behind him !
he should have never been elected , period .
congress could have acted on an immigration bill , but didn &apos;t .
# worstresponders # mitchmcconnell # dotherightthing
political correctness is a communist ideology .
sure took you long enough rino
please do not vote for cloture .
there you go , once again this lawless administration flouts the law .
i respect you senator enzi .
obama is not using good judgement for america !
making it more simple leaves less room for corruption and easier to keep up with
dirty harry wants it his way !
this tax will put me in prison .
no expanded back ground checks mr enzi we have enough feel good legislation--
start standing up for us , and not yourselves !
i &apos;ll be watching sir .

i &apos;m looking forward to obummer being out of our white house !
glad to hear it sir .
lindsey is a politician and a good one ! ! !
the tsa uses financial terrorism to get us to comply .
who will introduce a bill making obamacare apply to all of congress ?
you had years to propose something on immigration but you did nothing ........
he has no respect for the constitution or the rule of law .
hopefully something will pass before we default .
you and so many others rand .
too little too late , paul .
you were bought by devos .
i also will not support those that did not support ted cruz .
praying : (
the flag didn &apos;t do anything .
she is grossly unqualified to lead our schools .
we dont need to turn our backs on israel .
it &apos;s their way or no way !
congress needs to stand up and risk losing their cushy elected positions .
will be praying that you will succeed him !
anybody want to offer what it takes to impeach someone ? ,
plus was obama sleeping during it .
i voted for you in the sc gop presidential primary .
remember this the on the budget cr .
mrs. blackburn - you can say it anytime you want .
please put your words into action and start the process to impeach trump .
the founding fathers of this country are spinning in their graves .

today began the death of america because of obamacare
keep up the good fight tom , you are a blessing !
mclame &amp; graham are both weasels .... keep standing strong rand .
mccain it &apos;s about time !
you did not represent the majority of georgians who elected you !

cutting half the epa would have an immediate positive effect on the economy .
stand with rand and others standing with him .
amen mr. langford ...
think long and hard and please vote no ! !
pray your removed from office .
aid = tyranny .
i a m glad you are praying for all the victims .
rubio , christie and cruz
lankford , you &apos;re an idiot .
he has lost it !
i don &apos;t always agree with you , scott , but that &apos;s america .
oh i forgot , the flag killed people , not him .
as to romney , you still have time to nominate ron paul .
maybe marco will do his job know .
i want obamacare all my friends want obamacare .
you bet i agree with you trey gowdy !
mike dicks mike , thanks for your reply .
we r ruined if congress doesn &apos;t get this bill out of house .
obama is the reason of the season of our discontent .
what is congress going to do about this lawless president ?
that is so disappointing .
you are on the wrong side of history , mia love !
god bless you sir and god bless america !
great speech senator paul .
great churchill quote @ scott .
unfortunatly removing the flag is only the begining .
printing and borrowing more money by congress will not solve the problem .
remenber your oath to uphold the constitution !
lifting them in prayer
there should be no increase or extension of any debt limit .
this attitude is why i moved away from tn as quickly as i could .
hahahaha ...... oh that wasn &apos;t a rhetorical question ?
obama sucks mccain rules
yes keep working for and praying for that
the entire republican party has been taken over by the libertarians .
we are short a senator and could use some real conservatives here .
amen mia love we were all created by god .
bruce , do you care to substantiate that claim ?
you voted the way obama and boehner wanted you to vote oday .

way to go congressman ted yoho
now sir ..... stop obama !
obummer ain &apos;t too worried about that ~ hey !
no absolutely not no way
&quot; we the people &quot; need to show our disgust in our vote .
rand paul keep pushing o and his goons .
i guess they don &apos;t want our vote to stay in !
he has taken god out of our schools and on our money .
i don &apos;t support any of the obamacare bill .
enough of this president and his liberal agenda .
we should be drilling for oil nearer to the coast and on land .
spending cuts should start with foreign aid .
foreign aid could go ?
do away with them , national sales tax or a 10 % flat tax .
we will continue to pray for you and your family .
you and mccain might as well register as a dem .
we need you as the new speaker
praying for you and all our leaders to continue to stand firm
and why is our politians not demanding answers ? ?
the government needs power thus we loose freedom .
i &apos;d rather trust a christian
why are we giving away any money when we are borrowing money to begin with
&apos; &quot; happy thanksgiving trey gowdy to you &amp; your family !
obama and reid are bullies .
he wants to drastically limit the power of our senate and congress .
georgia bulldogs , of course .
very disappointed it took this defeat to get your attention paul ryan !
the people are still slaves to their communist dictator .
love ya marco .
i will vote for the republican nominee bit not proudly .
do you think they would do this to them selves hell no
he is very proud of his nebraska roots .
why don &apos;t you impeach him for treason ?
no experience required !
of course you &apos;re doing all you can , jerry .
rand , theres nothing exciting about what is going on these days .
i read that in congressman &apos;s trey gowdy &apos;s voice .
keep it up senator paul , we are pulling for you .
please do not vote for betsy devos for secretary of education .
mccain its too bad we hav a dumbass terrorist president : p
stop this lawless pos and put him and his administration in jail where they belong
senator scott , please clarify for us what is really going on with syria .
ms. devos does not have the knowledge or credentials required of this position .
your right steve , mia rocks .
cut spennding , do not raise the debt ceiling .
born in indiana , raised in georgia .
the idiot spends millions to go to cuba to be an idiot .
where is the town hall meeting ?
hard to trust your word when you sold out and endorsed romney and ryan .
marsha voted yes to this bill .
reid just wants to keep spending .
he must be impeached and put behind bars !
obama has a plan , an agenda that he was trained for .
enough talk ... impeach the usurper in the white house
mr. paul , i never watched cspan before !
mitch is ahead by 9 points !
stand firm , james .
he is one you never hear anything of .
write obama and tell him that we dont need any healthcare reform .
rand paul is doing the right thing !
we love and respect you mr. gowdy but your better then this
in south carolina you do not have to join a union to work .
i don &apos;t know one teacher who thinks devos is qualified for this position .
for shame sir !
praying , god bless america
he caved a second time .
and to you and yours trey gowdy !
kelvin brock i should know you .... my family from buffalo sc .
we need to figure out what to do with lindsey graham though .
cruz and lee for driving wedges between republicans over their fight to defund obamacare .
keep fighting for us , senator lankford !
lets cut our out of control military spending first .
close our borders to everyone until this problem is resolved .
no problem you bunch of idiots .
idaho needs the medicaid expansion !
sir , when is your next town hall ?
too bad there will be so many willing to sacrifice themselves for obama .
that makes our elected officials just as guilty as he is
so the american tax payer pays for the enemy to live here .
deport all illegals .
you absolutely love this country and only want the best for it .
i do not feel that ms. devos is qualified for this position
marco , you are a class act .
it &apos;s hard to trust anyone rand .
grow up mia and be loyal to the republican party and the american people .
stop the nonsense , and stop the welfare for refugees and illegals .
show some integrity and start impeachment proceedings against him .
why john mccain lost the 2008 presidential election .
i &apos;m tired of obama &apos;s attitude .
keep up the good work mr. yoho .
2. my father paid 60-65 % income tax .
amen greg
we don &apos;t need her vote bruce poliquin .
epa = no common sense .
the john sharpton show .
what a shame the republican party did this to the american people ! ! !
like last time you shut the government down ?
because he thinks he is never wrong .
i think obama is purposely trying to degrade our military forces .
please continue to fight mr. mccain .
nothing lower time to clean house
too bad you didn &apos;t come out months ago !
do not repeal the aca .
rand run for prez in 2016

republican or democrat does not matter .... establishment is establishment !
i &apos;m with you marco
marco rubio is my favorite president !
mr. proverbs is usually right ...
i am ashamed as a georgia resident that you made such remarks .
he doesn &apos;t have the authority under the constitution to bypass congress this way .
we are all americans and mr. obama is president despiete whats said .
not much longer and we will have a pro israel president in office .
the shooter was not ryan lanza , but his younger brother adam .
you and sen. ted cruz are showing leadership , something we so desperately need !
trey gowdy / every loves you / for americans / kansas
and god bless you trey gowdy .

i would not be turning to &quot; newsok.com &quot; for direction on constitutional law .
yeah and under the constitution that &apos;s grounds for impeachment .
i have no comment regarding south carolina
tom scott , i am proud of you .
everytime a terrorist strikes , obama wants the people &apos; s guns .
obamacare is the settled law of the land .
o won &apos;t do that because he thinks he knows it all .
obama will do nothing different
he needs to admit when he was wrong .
i want to meet to talk about pre-existing conditions , epa , education .
rubio doing good
he is the enemy !
close borders tenness needs to join other states
please quit making everything all or none !

obama is just a lapdog for the elites look for methods there .
maybe send him to prison after we get rid of him .
lately to see why he has crawled under the obama rock ?
mia , i too was dissapointed at obamas speech .
obama promised to pull out of the middle east .
south carolina and the south handled this situation with dignity and respect .
at least he &apos;s reporting it , versus the obama die-hards .
i would like to see obama care put to a vote of the people .
that probably took 5 hours , what else have you done besides nothing .
rand is a nutcase .....
you can not completrly secure a border .
praying for your victory , mia .
look , stand your ground congressman !
2nd amendment and securing the border then getting rid of all illegal aliens .
need daniel webster as speaker
i am outraged at this rampant spending of tax payers dollars .
u need to resign .
i &apos;m tired of working til may before my income is mine !
let &apos;s hope the republican establishment in washington sees the light .
hey paul , you should have said this a long time ago .
he is out to destroy america have no doubt !
mr lankford , can you guys not start impeachment processes on this man ?
castro &apos;s minions are still running cuba .
the onion hacked your page sir !
then close the border or is trump the only one using common sense .
senator moran , do the right thing and work for gun control now !
sir , you have failed us .
lol nobama
mia , you are a part of the problem , not the solution .
he wants to go back now .
praying for his family ! !
that makes it an unconstitutional law .
congressman coffman , you are an admirable man and i appreciate this gesture .
flimsy graham strikes again .
if i were the president i would resign .
you &apos;d sell us out just like mr. obama did .
and congress consistently ignores impeachment of this lawless president !
reagan was a republican as i recall
how much longer will they allow obama to change the law without congress .
looking forward to listening to you speak this evening louie gohmert !
get in their face rand
no most of the senate and obuma needs to be fired dummy
the federal government has no constitutional authority to make educational decisions .
senator portman you have a great responsibility in representing all ohioans .
3.get rid of obama care !
they will be lying .
earmarks is just one of those token issues that gets politicians fake conservative credibility .
i know that in 2010 he talked of the drones .
senator mccain , i know you love this country .
you are wasting your time on that liberal network .
president obama is absolutely right .
if you mean what you say about obamacare , vote no on cloture !
lovely post rand paul .
fund the zadroga act now .
a flat tax and abolish the monster called irs .
i switched to be a limited government republican .
i &apos;ve heard many say that being liberal and being christian is an oxymoron .
i &apos;m thankful for sen. hagan and hope we can keep her in 2014 !
i do believe we have been keeping an eye on the obama administration .
well duh ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
it appears your * crusade * to defund the aca is over , congressman .
no paul ryan , and glad kevin mccarthy dropped out .
he already bends over for obama .
the enemy of our enemy is still our enemy !
congress thinks immigration means amnesty .
praying for your little one .
most &quot; wacko birds &quot; assume everyone else is too !
we need more than just talk sir .
god love you ... keep you close ...
why haven &apos;t u called for obama &apos;s arrest impeachment or resignation ?
it is not obamacare !
i think you are a terrific , hard working patriot !
time to reshape the republican party with truth and principle .
we need congressmen like you to lead the charge against government tryanny .
yes repeal and replace
dont do it mr president ! ! !
stop trying to bamboozle the voting public---the republican party is in obama &apos;s pocket .
come on mid terms so we the people can fire all these lame losers .
oh yeah , boehner has got to go !
and everyone knows that paul ryan is the bestest , mostest conservative in washington .
obama did this because he likes communism .
y &apos;all need to do your job he is out of control .
wyoming summer storm in the coal mine .
not to obamacare and specially if the congress is exempt .
quess it only works if you voted for obama .
we must have a balanced budget and term limits for all elected officials .
we need more politicians like you that put country before party .
thanks for trying to help the american people &quot;
impeach the lot .
no fair !
glory be to god !
amen why enter a handshake with proven liars and enemies
this president needs to be impeached , now .
why can &apos;t trey gowdy be our president ?
revolt now .. time to stop the spending !
no he is a socialist ! ! !
so is this an impeachable offense ?
his resignation would be nice if not that for him to repeal the oboma care
mitch mcconnell is a fraud .
y &apos;all had better start doing it .
what is your honest opinion on obama care ?
i am a registered republican and a resident of tennessee .
amen senator graham - they are the finest in the world !
it needs to be oklahoma state !
❤ ️ you are next mia love - our first woman president !
mr graham i can no longer support you .
profoundly disappointing .
so mr. shuster , you have failed the people again .
rand is just playing along for those cuban votes when he runs .
obamacare strikes again .
option b. today , tomorrow and forever !
we should really get back to our constitutional roots .
i appreciate the representatives from wyoming standing for what wyomingites hold as important !
sen. paul , please keep up the good work .
there is no way he will ever get elected ... it will never happen .
agree agree agree
i am a republican and a conservative , but this is just plain wrong !
you should add , like if you think the illegals should be thrown out .
mr. mission accomplished was never drunk on power , i &apos;m sure .
that &apos;s because he don &apos;t care about america ! !
disgusting rino .
fairtax not flat tax .
it is in our national security interest !
wish the feds would actually listen to the people who elected them .
pass the zadroga act , you giant coward .
mccain and goober are the wackos and they need to exit stage right !
why ? , the government is just wasting it anyway .
how do you bleed freedom &amp; liberty out of that turnip ?
... we , at our household support you vern , will watch on fox
stand firm trey
hey robert , have you been going to public schools ?
fair tax , no deductions , no loopholes .
why can &apos;t you have open town hall meetings ?
mr. corker please vote no for betsy devos ! !
other prominent republicans and conservative talk radio hosts backed palin &apos;s statement .
the rest are rinos .
neither is boehner , nor graham , nor many other inside the beltway rinos .
makes me question your ability to represent the good people of tn .
mc cain you are a trader and oath breaker .
failed liberal policies after picking up the pieces from the bush administration ?
we need to take the republican party back !
you &apos;re welcome vern .
you and aaron schock should never have gone along with boehner and the democrats .
obama , dept of justice , fbi are all corrupt .
i hope you might reconsider .
force federal mandates , mr .
what do you expect again from a republican party .
the anti christ must be stopped now !
flat tax and everyone pays .
such cowards ... afraid of shutting down the government .
i don &apos;t think mchenry ever replies does he ?
god bless isreal and usa !
you are a farce and far from a conservative .
obamacare is economic pick up ... this program is not free .
let &apos;s fire lindsey graham in the next election .
i would still vote for you or rubio or allen west or ben carson .
maintains the rights of the citizens and keeps our constitution intact .
as long as mr gowdy is involved things will turn out ok
you advance trade to advance liberty .
sorry you decided not to listen to your constituents .
here is senator jeff sessions speaking in regard of ted cruz .
fox is five times more credible than anything the left has to offer .
so ... what &apos;re you going to do about it congressman ?
you claim to support the law , and the constitution .
no question about it
your doing great james !
and repeal obamacare , and impeach it &apos;s namesake ! !
well the truth would have been nice for once .
it looks like comey isn &apos;t the only one she and bill got to .
kick his ass rand !
flat tax would encourage business to form here .
just get our country back .
thank god ... vote no
just repeal the unconstitutional thing ... oh yeah , i forgot !
rubio will be the next president .. period .
at least senator rubio has the gabonzas to speak what he believes in .
but it wasn &apos;t taken by foreign enemies .
yes mike you are so right on .
obama care does not provide what has been promised and what is needed .
get rid of epa period !
respectfully , marion h. eason , hinesville , ga .
instead of repealing and replacing why not just fix what is already in place ?
that is so true ! !
stay after them mr. lankford !
she has no experience in education and is unqualified .
a clean cr only admits the failure of the senate .
thanks yah for mr. trey gowdyhttps : / / youtu.be / 5uiem5p89ke
marco , i really thought you were smarter than that .
this is going to finally ruin the republican party ! !
eliminate the irs .
even christie
we need to get rid of the irs !
i consider the veto one of the very few things he has done right .
a yes vote for the patriot act is a disappointment !
protect snowden while you are at it .
reagan gave us double digit unemployment and tripled the national debt .
impeach is the only thing that will stop this outlaw
i would have expected more from you mccain .
it &apos;s unconstitutional do these morons not know our constitution
i was so sad about marco love him cannot stand christie
so ...... what are you guys going to do about it .
marco rubio is a lying dirtball who belongs in a cage not in congress .
you earned this mr speaker and no one gave it to you .
i &apos;d like to know what obama &apos;s agenda is .
obama , the enemy from within .
senator mccain 1st build the border fence !
mccain takes it up the ass
i hope you can defeat obama &apos;s agenda .
father god protect our nation .
martha you are the best .
amen senator and god bless you also !
there are still moderates and democrats in georgia ya know ?
so why is congress allowing him to get away with it ?
you sir need to go on out to pasture with saxby !
you can &apos;t compromise with enemies of freedom .
amen ! , brother !
rich tax loopholes , cut them and make a strait line tax rate .
go gowdy go
they don &apos;t want the constitution .
i suppose that &apos;s up to obama to show whether he has that wisdom .
the people need a constitution party .
not only us but our forefathers and the spirit of the most high god .
since when was there an effort to repeal the 19th amendment ?
i do not listen to his speeches .
what enemies in arizona do we need them to help fight ?
never ever gone live without testing testing testing .
you mistake the matter completely sir .
keep going senator paul .
no imigration bills until the border is certified closed .
it &apos;s just all apart of god &apos;s plan .
comey caved to the pressure .
disappointed mr. mccain .
defund obamacare - now !
i agree with you bruce on this but only this .
with redistricting , tom will be our new congressman .
he has already told us he can do anything he wants .
i am quickly falling in line with rand paul .
conservatives across the nation need to channel thier anger towards the november elections !
keep up the good work , diane !
keep up the good work sir .
skf in hobart , southwest oklahoma .
you &apos;re accountable for it all , vern .
i pray that congress will support israel especially against these islamic terrorists
rand paul and cruz are not afraid of the dictator
i would like to hear him impeach himself
give it up , ben .
but some people will do anything to get a little air time on cnn .
wtg mia
yes , we are .the enemy is inside the gates .
the rinos strike again .
now let &apos;s get rid of common core and the dept of education !
and obama has no constitutional authority to mandate anything to anyone - period .
obama still thinks he is king .
well , it &apos;s about time paul ryan - too little , too late .
he should be impeached for the treason he has committed against this country .
speaking of principle , why not craft a bill to put prayer back in schools
make bo &amp; dems come to table .
i &apos;ll certainly be listening to see what glenn beck has to say .
an incomprehensible tax code that most people cannot navigate has no true meaning ?
vote for ted cruz !
why is it so hard to impeach this so called president .
gotta love ron paul !
attorney general we want trey gowdy mr trump
congress needs to stand their ground .
will you please show some by supporting a balanced solution ?
please support the defunding of obamacare .
god bless our military and their families and god bless america !
james , im very thankful god has kept you in congress .
good grief .... no wonder our country is in the shape its in !
i &apos;m from janesville , and i &apos;m ashamed of you paul ryan .
the rinos have funded obamacare , knowingly .
this treaty goes in the round file , with kyoto .
bitter talk rand paul
this bill couldn &apos;t limit the authority of the president without an amendment process .
also , eric holder must be held accountable for his actions .
impeach and jail obama &amp; clinton &amp; their whole gang of mendacious traitors !
please don &apos;t repeal the obama care .
may god continue to bless and watch over you !
hang all traitors
keep their feet to the fire rand ! !

good-bye graham
i agree hr mcclintock , run ........ now .

stand strong in your faith &lt; 3 god bless you !
repeal it now and nothing less
he is going to keep on doing damage --- get rid of him ! !
poor gitmo prisoners !
please start representing us in sc .
keeping the government closed is wasting money .
graham , you voted for cloture ... how is that going to stop obamacare ?
we can stop the spending .
so true we need to cut the size of goverment
god is watching !
congress has the power to declare war , not the president .
a big heck no
edward snowden is a &quot; hero &quot; in my eyes !
re elect trey please
webster but not ryan
he is never held accountable .
with evil there can be no compromise
i would love to hear him resign
maybe idaho should quit giving our land away to communists !
so &quot; says &quot; the constitution
it is not the first time the position of potus has been ursurped .
hmmm did our own south dakota mike rounds get charged for his scandals ?
amen you and your dad would of made a heck of a team !
he hates the us and the military too
mia , he doesn &apos;t care .
some thing has to be done before it is too late !
sir , what need is there to comment when elected officials already know ?
and you voted for boehner on your very first vote .
then you sell out . , see ya traitor
a legal and safe process to protect our borders is what americans want .
no rand .
do not repeal obamacare , just fix the kinks to make it work better .
no , congressman poe .
and please defund obamacare !
restore liberty and reduce the national debt .
maybe mccain and obama should be paying you out of their pockets .
pass the zadroga 9 / 11 health and compensation act .
we need the truth sir .
please put your political interests aside and support our first responders # worstresponders
cut spending and cut regulation .
he can &apos;t give gitmo to the cubans until it is empty .
and i could not afford healthcare before obamacare - now i can .
ya &apos;ll keep sucking up to him &amp; turning your supporters away from yourself .
we &apos;re all out here praying .. my entire family voted for you today ..
no reason to reward a gop donor to this important position
the election is invaild since the irs got involved by orders of obama
why is it that obama does not understand what a law is .
sir you are voting when you stay home .
stop all the executive orders .

interest rates on our debt are at a historical low .
senate republicans caved , all tax hikes , zero spending cuts .

now is the time for republicans to take a stand .
no exceptions
stand tall for america .
flat tax but no taxes on social security
ditto tom
he is so self absorbed that his judgment cannot be trusted .
deepest respect and thanks senator paul .
you took an oath to defend us from all enemies foreign and domestic .
i am with you senator rand , let &apos;s run with this .
rand paul / ted cruz for president and vp
lets hope , and pray
rand paul is a sellout .
and congress will do nothing
trey greyson is also a neocon or you would not be supporting him .
for our government is no longer for the people and by the people .
additional laws won &apos;t change anything sir .
leave the flag .
we recognize obamacare is a failure and repealing !
i think its time for impeachment !

the 4th is a day , independence day is the day .
that way no one gets soft ball questions like bush got all evening .
james , i love the messenger of the question !
mccain - where the eff have you been for the last 8 years .
mccain proves once again how much of a rino trashbag he is .
no one else cut him slack .

a blessed feast day of saint benedict to you congressman bruce .

the real danger america is in for collapse coming sooner .
i would vote no

prayers for a true conservative win today .
if we let oboma stay then we look @ higher taxes .
no sorry !
it is only meant to spy on patriotic americans .
god bless our president
obama thinks he can do whatever he wants whenever he wants .
this obama care did not smell right from the beginning !
mia , you do not understand what his job is .
obama will destroy our great country if we just sit back and do nothing .
he &apos;s boehner on steroids .
god bless and guide you sir .
obama &apos;s budget year on year is lower than bush .
across the board spending cuts and across the board tax increases .
maybe you should &apos;ve said something when he made all those changes to obamacare .
poe keeps voting yea so this guy can sign . ! .
spearhead a movement to go to a fair tax or flat tax .
trey gowdy is the man don &apos;t back down ! !

hope you enjoy your $ $ $ $ from the drug companies .
you and hillary should both burn in hell with bill
have no respect left for booker .
then watch hillary &apos;s response .... steady and cool .
you are the best amy klobuchar !
