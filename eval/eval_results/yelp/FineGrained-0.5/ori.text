ever since joes has changed hands it 's just gotten worse and worse .
there is definitely not enough room in that part of the venue .
she said she 'd be back and disappeared for a few minutes .
i ca n't believe how inconsiderate this pharmacy is .
it is n't terrible , but it is n't very good either .
new owner , i heard - but i do n't know the details .
we sit down and we got some really slow and lazy service .
the charge did include miso soup and a small salad .
there was no i 'm sorry or how did everything come out .
said we could n't sit at the table if we were n't ordering dinner .
the cash register area was empty and no one was watching the store front .
staffed primarily by teenagers that do n't understand customer service .
the burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy .
blue cheese dressing was n't the best by any means .
there was only meat and bread .
she was not happy being there .
the sales people here are terrible .
i was n't going to let her do a thing further to me .
they tried to take advantage of me because i am young .
always rude in their tone and always have shitty customer service !
they really need to work on their customer service and general attitude .
i skipped eating and we went back to the beer .
my `` hot '' sub was cold and the meat was watery .
you wo n't find a better selection in scottsdale .
i asked for thai hot and received very little spice .
i was very sick the night after .
i just left this car wash and was very unsatisfied !
had one mediocre meal and said , `` we 'll try again '' .
then he proceeded to tell me how to fix it .
do not go to this practice they are horrible !
i guess she was n't happy that we were asking the prices .
the only saving grace was the black beans .
lost a long time customer !
other than that , food here is pretty gross .
i was also curious about another product but he straight up walked off .
the food was pretty bad , i would not go there again .
you 'll have zero appetite after the first bite .
do n't go here unless you want to pay for crap .
but it may not actually be in stock anyway .
owner : a very rude man .
stopped by for soda after being at the hobby shop next door .
it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces .
this spot was my favorite indian restaurant .
but was very disappointed with what actually arrived .
his offer of a `` free dessert '' was even more atrocious .
i was so disgusted i could not way for the rest of the day .
the salads are ok , nothing special .
the woman did n't even apologize .
zero complaints with his work .
they wo n't tell you though .
i love the food ... however service here is horrible .
<UNK> itself however is not so amazing .
needless to say i will not be back for mexican food .
let me give my opinion , that 's what this site is for .
she did not apologize or anything .
but this place was not economical so the expectation was different .
it smelled and tasted like yesterday 's oil .
the beer sauce is lackluster at best .
i 've never had a worse experience than this !
no , i 'm not at a scottsdale club .
if i could give zero stars i def would .
only now i 'm really hungry , and really pissed off .
i wish i could give less than one star .
if i could give less stars , i would .
she could not and would not explain herself .
it 's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty .
as an arizona native , i have been going to the <UNK> for years .
so , no treatment and no medication to help me deal with my condition .
so who do i call to get my money back .
overcooked so badly that it was the consistency of canned tuna fish .
service was a little slow to begin with .
i expected so much better from this ny staple .
i had to leave a message , and they never called me back .
the food is worse than you find in the freezer section at walmart .
they tried real hard to get me to come back but i refused .
i wanted to like this place but it just became a big disappointment .
when i was finally there , i was very disappointed .
so sad but i am not going back any more .
this is the worst walmart neighborhood market out of any of them .
just do n't bother ordering anything if you 're seated .
this place is just ok .
i have to say i was truly disappointed .
this is the reason i will never go back .
when the manager finally showed up he was rude and dismissive !
the office also failed to even apologize about this whole horrific experience .
nope , way way worse .
there are no smiles and no customer service .
when she did n't answer him quickly enough , he hung up on her .
the fried rice was gross and there was a shit load of it .
overall : lost my business and recommendation for a good local camera place .
it was so odd , i asked her if she was joking ?
was n't busy , no biggie .
also , the food that is there is n't great even by buffet standards .
exhibit c : no more student services peeps .
so disappointing from an old favorite .
it shows because on a saturday night there was n't a long wait .
i will never visit the salon again .
they only received one star because you have to provide a rating .
this was by far the rudest person i spoke with .
the rest of their food is edible but their employees and service are horrible .
as for the food , never had it .
i 'm from the bay area and this was a disappointment and over priced .
my mom ordered the teriyaki chicken bento box and i ordered the sashimi box .
i ordered garlic bread and fettuccine alfredo pasta with vegetables .
it does not take that long to cook sliders !
the sandwich was not that great .
the man did not stop her .
tasted really old , i could n't believe it .
we 've been to this long established restaurant many times .
we gave it another 5-10 minutes before we got up and left .
even the ice cream was very , very run of the mill .
wendy 's has been know to be cheap with their drink refills for years .
the service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average .
just terrible is all i can say .
did they not have a fountain machine on site ?
stay away , and go to cheesecake instead .
i 've eaten here many times , but none as bad as last night .
however , everyone else paid after their nails were completed .
so , that was my one and only time ordering the benedict there .
overall , i do n't enjoy the place very much .
one of the employees apologized , but it did n't seem very sincere .
but let this story begin at noon today .
but their inventory was questionable !
chicken fried chicken was dry but the green chili macaroni and cheese was good .
were we irritating her or something ?
this place has pissed me off for the last time .
do not sign a lease with these people .
i mean that 's been my experience !
the beef taco was good but nothing special .
either way i would never recommend buying from camping world .
i went to sit down and wait for my order .
he did not return my call either .
very crowded , difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .
you can not pay me to ever shop here !
french toast plate was good , mom said , but eggs were cold .
now the food : not horrible , but below average .
this is easily the worst greek food i 've had in my life .
no stars is what in want to give .
when it came we should have sent it back .
the equipment is so old and looks dirty .
<UNK> 's failed on every occasion .
management no longer cares about the golf experience .
the chow mein was very mushy and had weird texture .
found the place even though it is hard due to bad signage .
two hours of my life i can never get back .
very disappointed and would stay clear of this place .
what the hell are you doing ?
the dipping sauce was too sweet too .
finally , the cheese crisp was tiny and was anything but crisp .
i checked online , and the coupon site said my certificate was good .
liar , liar , pants on fire .
this is an old worn out hotel .
this place is a shit hole with shit service .
went back in for adjustment , realized still incorrect .
the only thing i was offered was a free dessert .
i had a horrible experience , and i sadly would not come back .
it is not really brown rice .
i ordered a cesar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
had it not been so terribly hot , it would have just been inconvenient .
she did offer me a copy if i would like a soda while waiting .
it did n't get finished .
absolutely terrible , do not order from this place .
ate kicked ass , <UNK> , not so much .
even the water tasted horrible .
sounds good does n't it ?
yes , the portions were large , but size is n't everything .
it was over fried and very hard .
i have not received such an attitude toward a customer before .
the overall prices are not competitive with frys .
too bad it was at the expense of the other customers .
we 'll see if that happens , but i 'm not holding my breath .
and management does n't do anything about it .
what were you going to charge me when i purchase a dozen bagels ?
these days the quality is pretty lousy .
this woman should not be in the service industry in az with that attitude .
service was average but could not make up for the poor food and drink .
my husband had to walk up to the bar to place our wine order .
and the pizza was cold , greasy , and generally quite awful .
maybe they were having a bad night ?
it was embarrassing for all involved , though i do n't think he noticed .
so i ordered my tires online , scheduled an appointment for two days out .
hopefully , i do n't take any bed bugs with me .
the beer is n't bad , but the food was less than desirable .
i was very disappointed with this place .
geez i need to find a source for those uni blocks ... .
she does n't say anything and just walks away .
it tasted like melted plastic and had the same tough consistency .
i acknowledged this and he went back to take care of the bill .
what a waste of my time and theirs .
one was for my dog , and one was for my wife 's dog .
my fault for not looking more closely , i guess .
the server was n't buying .
worst customer service i have ever had .
this branch is getting worse and worse .
they can thank you for the low rating .
i did n't even eat it .
this was the first time i ever cried from a haircut .
if i was n't with my coworker , i would 've walked out .
i did n't know ra was a chain .
i 'm sure they must get it right some days but not this day .
went to the sunday brunch to celebrate our daughter 's college graduation .
this is the third time they 've messed up that spice .
the game room is a waste of time , energy and money .
i also told him i would leave him some good feedback online .
however , the manager came back & told me my order was coming up .
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
we told them to forget it , we did n't want to wait .
we will spend our money elsewhere .
i will never purchase another lv bag again .
horrible , horrible , horrible service !
this piece of shit gave me wonton crackers for my soup .
the rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland .
you can not judge people based on appearance .
you are not the only place in town with decent pizza .
i would never reccomend anyone to live here .
great food but horrible staff and very very rude workers !
next dish was moo goo gai pan to which the sauce is the secret .
tonight i lost all respect for this company .
let me tell you , this place was far from busy !
the birthday surprise has been ruined as well as her special day .
included in this price was a credit card fee and an after midnight fee .
the only item was able to eat was the soggy broccoli beef !
unfortunately , it is the worst .
the place has obviously gone downhill over the years .
this is the worst panda express location there is !
the door would n't open at all .
my services were very rushed and she did n't even do a good job .
the ceiling air conditioner in the hallway is very loud .
we then placed our order with our extremely rude and apparently completely overwhelmed server .
i may just post pictures to prove their shoddy work .
it is way overpriced ( compare to what they serve !
sadly , i will probably never be able to eat at this place again .
i said it was disgusting to even serve this to diners .
we both found it overcooked -- and no seasonings .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said she was unsure .
it 's just too expensive for what you get .
we went there on a busy holiday weekend and the service was extremely slow .
if i was the manager , i 'd fire that kid on the spot .
too bad too because they brew an outstanding beer .
will never go back to kfc - they essentially stole from me !
the surly older waitress was a huge bummer .
needless to say , i will not be returning to this place ever again .
firstly , their fees are generally higher than other places .
anything they say , ask in writing .
this is a far cry from real new mexican cuisine .
if i had wanted it washed i would have washed it myself !
incredible , low price specials and the occasional groupon .
the green enchiladas were ok but not great .
i tried to no avail .
university is also almost as bad as living on apache .
perhaps bread should be offered at no charge .
took my suite to get fitted and a new button put on it .
desert followed but nothing special .
no massage with my manicure or pedicure .
i called at 6:30 and got the complete brush off .
they 're nowhere near any fight that breaks out .
since their visit , the only scorpions we 've seen were dead !
so one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs .
this location is super busy and really could use double the staff .
i guess starbucks customer services is only good at some locations .
no , not the ones at asu , the ones in junior high .
three women met for lunch last friday at <UNK> at the <UNK> .
ra sushi , you are so blah to me .
half of my head was over processed .
an old dude did my pedicure .
`` no , we are going to have a tournament tomorrow .
they do not stock some of the most common parts .
it 's small yet they make you feel right at home .
i will be going back and enjoying this great place !
my husband got a ruben sandwich , he loved it .
i signed up for their email and got a coupon .
oh i got my band geek back on now !

prices are a tad high but worth it .
the message therapist is awesome also .
came here with my family .
brittany gave me a very new haircut and transformed me completely .
this resort has been in scottsdale forever and it truly knows service .
