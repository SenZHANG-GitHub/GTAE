tammy waiting for you to come on hardball here in new jersey .
reminds me when bernie had the popular vote but no &quot; super delegates &quot; .

trump and his whole cabinet needs to go .
i just found fault with you ms. warren !
you are our equality defender .

this woman sounds like a typical hillary support .
keith - no answer for what ?
you &apos;re full of it booker .
i can trust mr doggett to do the right thing for our country !
hillary was not the candidate for the dnc to shove down our throats .
) you are absolutely right tammy .
that is what the electoral college is about .
i believe that mr. sanders supports the working class people of america .
i &apos;m glad you &apos;re going to be the next senator from massachusetts !

elizabeth have you decided who your ancestors are yet ?
chuck schumer had this idea for the ny state address too .

the left only wants equal rights for those with whom they agree .

we don &apos;t want obama <UNK> .
thanks for all you do senator paul !
i &apos;m a conservative and i vote .
sir you are a man of honor .
is he president or a communist commander ? ? ? ? ?
and for you , mr. graves .
i assume flat tax is out of the question .
it is not just the cuban &apos;s who want rubio .
obama doesn &apos;t care about the law .
no wonder obama wants to attack syria .
i don &apos;t see that in our constitution .
the grandstanding is with obama and his minions .
you &apos;re a disgusting piece of slime , mr. graham .
i am a retired border patrol agent in your district .
god sent you to us for a reason !
dear john boehner , thanks for nothing !

senator mccain , i &apos;ve respected you and your politics for many years .
he knew he had nothing to talk about as he failed in all fronts .
go rand paul ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
the entire maine delegation wasn &apos;t even allowed in the hall ... !
the only clear choice is for obama and holder to resign .
i don &apos;t trust our current president with our military .
go away little marco u missed the train maybe you can get a real job
this is very good news for marco rubio .
that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with the republican party .
spending cuts alone will not pay off this debt .
mia is such a class act , so refreshing .
fair tax is the only way to go !
we can only pray not .
trey your words are exact .
obamacare is from hell ( literally ) !
i &apos;m sure senator ted cruz appreciates your support .
and they call themselves the party of the fiscal conservatives .
tom , thanks for taking a stand on this .
i don &apos;t trust our current president with our military .
obamacare does not drive down cost .
marco rubio .... we love you .
hey , was marco rubio there ?

happy new year to the tillis family !

mccain and lindsey were not happy with your stunt .
i thought much more highly of trey gowdy than this .
do not let this go <UNK> our future and liberty are at stake !
a balance budget amendment is a waste of time .
you just do not get it ben .
do you think we should take our troops out of germany and south korea ?
rand paul , for standing up for us .
johnny , does georgia have 3 isis training camps ? ? ?
let &apos;s repeal those and watch the federal <UNK> open up !

show the american people and vote no on cloture and defund obamacare !
obama should resign for the good of the country .
marco please don &apos;t stop .
you are dead center correct sir
there needs to be a big rethink or foreign aid altogether .

cruz is not who he is saying he is .
don &apos;t cave in ! ! !
praying for you , your family , and your co-workers .
rubio 2016 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
stand up with cruz , keep it going !
what does the flag have to do with this tragedy ?

happy thanksgiving to you and your family as well congressman trey gowdy .
but he &apos;s found millions he wants to send to jordan .
all the best to you mr scott .
why did you vote to fund obamacare last year ?
impeachment that &apos;s what we want .
mr. lankford he doesn &apos;t care .
yes , i heard you and senator graham , and i agree with you .
the senate passed a bill for funding dhs is no amnesty in it .
mr. gowdy should <UNK> on keeping on .
go sen graham go ! ! !
lindsey , thanks for the work .
it doesn &apos;t work that way , mia .
conservatives should stick to their promise .
the constitution has been made a joke of .
i know it was a tough decision jerry .
the feds have no business in this .
let me guess , you &apos;ll be talking about obamacare
# standwithrand # <UNK> # <UNK> # <UNK> .
so when are you handing in your resignation ? ?
please stand with the american people and vote to defund the affordable care act .
i &apos;m very proud of you , marsha !
i absolutely love trey gowdy and his abilities .
whats new with reid he always does what he wants
rand looked confident and spoke eloquently - as usual .
that &apos;s not a threat like johnny caupert .
the illegal transfer of 5 gitmo prisoners for <UNK> is grounds for impeachment !
trey gowdy should run for dog catcher .
i &apos;d like to see mia love as speaker .
keep fighting for our service personnel , mia !
you have become part of the establishment gop .
that he &apos;s resigning and taking his doofus vice president with him .
voting conservative in primaries is critical .
has <UNK> mccain really helped <UNK> &apos;s see some proof .
a very happy thanksgiving patriot , trey gowdy and your family .
go trump , impeach hillary ! !
i hope and pray trey gowdy would do this .
i mean dr. carson actually is .
john mc cain <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>

rand paul will do a lot more for freedom than anyone since his father .
so yes i am with you scott .
he needs to pull his head out of his ass !
happy thanksgiving mr.gowdy god bless you and your family .
he doesn &apos;t care what the people of oklahoma wants .
this is so much bigger than you and the republican party .
so hello amnesty and bigger government .
you &apos;ve got my vote mitch .
don &apos;t send any of our money to anybody !
mr mccain , i am not proud of her decision .
the very constitution he swore to uphold !
merry christmas trey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
i am a ron paul supporter and will always be .
why are you supporting that spineless boehner ?
it isn &apos;t rubio they want .
johnny , it is past time for impeachment proceedings to begin .
what christian values do you hold dear ?
he is now going to give away gitmo .
he solved problem using strong conservative action .
the iran treaty wasn &apos;t a treaty .
we need more rand paul &apos;s in congress .
tell them to send devos packing .
it was exactly what obama wanted divide the party .
i don &apos;t like anything obama says .
this is an outrage , and the senate republicans should act accordingly .
marco - run as an independent and i &apos;ll be right there with you .
marsha , marsha , marsha , please , kindly stfu .
i am thankful you treasure our freedom !
please vote no on the patriot act .
merry christmas trey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
rand paul was on the attack tonight it was impressive .
either support the republican party or get out .

merry christmas trey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
merry christmas trey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>

yes , it &apos;s a national issue but ms blackburn doesn &apos;t represent her .
on my way now , can &apos;t wait to vote for rand !
please support ted cruz and vote with him .
you lied , you lied , you lied !
praying in = = = = = jesus name
i honestly wish that rand , not ron paul was running .
obama should be impeached for he has done far worst than richard nixon .
<UNK> <UNK> peterson - mr. gowdy is <UNK> man ! !
and johnny mccain &apos;s butt boy to boot .
merry christmas trey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
and who was president when mr. obama said that ?
you paul are part of what trump campaigned against ! ! !
poison us for 35 permanent jobs ? ?
same goes for sam brownback !
what has been the republican answer ?
i agree that we need to repeal obamacare .
thank trey for keeping us informed .
fair tax is the best way to go .
no wonder graham and mccain don &apos;t agree
stay out of syria ... ship has already <UNK> .
rubio 2016 has a nice ring .

agree 100 % with you on this mitch !
prayers for the family and all in sc
god bless you for your service to our nation .

rand , do not pay attention to john mccain .
we thank god for you , mr gowdy !
i pray for your miracle and that god will give you strength and courage .
you have a lot of support rand , don &apos;t give up !
way to go , you spineless fool !
paul you are a disgusting pig .
i hope jesus loves you .
you don &apos;t represent me , mr. scott .
you senator portman are a fool .
they are traitors to the american people .
you and mccain are the reason we need term limits .
1 , keep up the fight rand !
boehner is so full of it .
your too worried about taking our 2nd <UNK> rights away , and making illegals
he has a degree in <UNK> sasse is a wolf in sheeps clothing .

rand paul for president and justin amash for vice president 2016 !

mr. rubio , please run for president in four years .
flat tax , eliminate irs as simple as that
merry christmas trey <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK>
who was obummer talking about ?
rand joining the &quot; birther &quot; movement is enough for me .
happy thanksgiving to you mr. trey gowdy and family .
betsy devos is highly unqualified to run the dept of public education .
we need to stop the epa by blocking the clean air act
i &apos;m a georgia constituent , and i oppose her nomination .
he is a muslim brotherhood <UNK> .
just like our immigration system needs to be fixed .
i hope the senate will commit to a conservative replacement .
we can all agree that we want pelosi fired from her speaker position .
you are truly a great patriot .
please vote to stop this horrible cave in agreement .
who cares what you think , marco .
you , sir , have been part of the problem .
have you started impeachment yet .
stand your ground mr gowdy and keep fighting for the american people .
all obama does is tells us what we want to hear .
he is a good guy and a brother in christ .
you voted to shut rand down .
paying for having our liberty stripped .
her testimony exposed her as a woefully unqualified candidate for that position .
thanks for that , sen. moran .
talk talk talk talk ... all talk and no action .
shame shame shame on you ryan !
you know the truth , tom and we know that you know !
it was good enough for reagan and bush .
