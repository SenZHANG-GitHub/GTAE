elaine &amp; i pray for you
i ask .... who are the real wacko birds ? ? ?
please reconsider and vote against devos .
obama needs to be stopped
and many of the actions are illegal by this administration !
mia we want you to vote no to h.r.
obama and john sullivan are laws unto themselves .
my question is what are you going to do about it ?
i think you should send them a cr to fund social security .
just another move to take away our liberty .
just secure our borders please ! !
act today i am the future of republican party .
vote hillary and rid us of boehner mcconnell mccain ryan and co
tim from tennessee .
it was a great speach and he &apos;s a great speaker !
democrats are traitors
reagan cut taxes bush 1 was the one who raised them
30 cent tax .
some moved to utah and idaho !
you are a true patriot senator mccain .
working to help pay for obama care
biden is at least legally qualified to hold the office .
you have betrayed our trust and our future generation .
what about the states that have no sales tax ?
no tricks .
mainly when they &apos;re <UNK> our enemies illegal weapons .
the man is a traitor in my opinion and should have already been impeached .
good point tom thanks !
tom , who r u , bold or <UNK> ? ?
there should be a way to veto his veto
no refugees , close borders .
happy birthday ms. marsha .
lisa , we need nothing new , just enforce what is in place .
please defund obamacare and oppose cloture .
no government loans ! ! ! ! !
praying for you and your loved ones senator tim scott ... &lt; 3
kudos mia
quite evident senator mccain didn &apos;t even read the bill .
please we need a real conservative in the senate !
get rid of barry aka obama .
they are god &apos;s chosen
marco : god bless you and your family .
why wasn &apos;t he the nominee in 2012 ?
the american people made a mistake when they didn &apos;t nominate john mccain .
i think the real question is why can &apos;t the republicans win more seats .
you got that exactly right scott , thanks for not <UNK> ... oh !
file charges or please shut up .
he thinks they are better than americans
mr. rubio you are just great !
do something to stop this ! !
well y &apos;all sure didnt care about benghazi .
they are elected to uphold the constitution and represent the people .
start the impeachment process then
just come out and tell the people the truth !
i wish i had your enthusiasm , rand .
our prayers are with her .
there will never be another reagan .
i would expect this of rubio , but not you tim scott .
jerry , you make <UNK> ... and , you can &apos;t spell !
that is why we sent you to congress .
it &apos;s clear hhs did not have this authority .
man , i thought he quit smoking dope ... apparently not .
remember the uss liberty
cruz !
president paul
i &apos;m stuck in your state too mr tom mcclintock tho different area .
obama is impeachment proof , he knows it and <UNK> accordingly .
rand is wrong on this .
sounds like his <UNK> colleagues might just need to push forward for impeachment !
obama had a lot more to do with obamacare ( without gop support ! )
keep it mr. paul we need solid voices such as yours in congress .
we need to get rid of the rino running against him .
please listen to your constituents and vote no on betsy devos .
you voted to keep spineless boehner as speaker .
we do have a spending problem .
it is disturbing enough that john kerry is sec .
is this not an impeachable offense ? !
keep fighting tim , we are behind you ..
because your president is a muslim himself vern
i &apos;ll echo <UNK> ... go johnny go ! ! ! !
ryan should be speaker of the house ....
too little , too late , mr. ryan .
and he stands for principles .
securing the borders is a mistake !
congressman king , it is time to impeach obama !
you have thousands of north carolinians who are telling you no to betsy devos .
the traitors in the republican party had better get their priorities in place .
surprise , surprise , he thinks we are all idiots like they are
an <UNK> who knows his government needs to do better .
~ ronald reagan -- &quot; politicians are like <UNK> .
jason move to cuba and you can have all the communism you can stand
reagan and george w bush .
they would of never voted for boehner either
defund obamacare , it will destroy the usa .
i &apos;ll be watching in north carolina .
none will be happy till our money is worthless .
do the right thing john and vote no on cloture !
the president has no legislative authority at all ..
senator lindsey graham has started horribly .
unequivocally , that person is not betsy devos .
john been following you from texas i support your <UNK> ideas .
also u do know that there are no direct flights to the usa .
and be exempt from obamacare
keep our second amendment and freedom in place !
<UNK> <UNK> marsha .
congressman thomas massie i find no fault in you quoting reagan .
cruz is a member of the establishment !
conway , sc
betsy devos is not qualified .
the very reason illegals come to this country for .
guess you showed your true color lou lost my vote
please senator mccain , do not abandon us or this country .
you sir have my attention !
mr lankford , why have you not taken a stand against mr. trump ?
quit trying to give obama room to create what is not possible .
stand strong ; stand on the foundation of truth , mr. gowdy .
john boehner is protecting obama and he needs to also go .
i pray you stick to the convictions stated above ! ! !
hey tom we need a leader now not later in dc .
give them heck <UNK> they violate our great constitution .
great decision made by utah
could have used a little more of this a few months ago .
wish you would have done this earlier but better late than never .
senate amendment in january to cut off this aid .
the obama administration has manipulated and flat out <UNK> the numbers before .
the present administration only needs to enforce them .
get your like-minded republican buddies and do something about it .
and bad for our freedom and liberty and country in general .
ted cruz is our only hope ! ! !
and their <UNK> disregard for the constitution and the american people .
better late than never you idiot !
common core is a states initiative that is not funded by the federal govt .
consider the source senator rand paul .
marco rubio for 2016 !
the epa and the federal gov .
you could start by <UNK> the fair tax and abolishing the irs !
ty bruce
hey do you realize how busy johnny is every day ?
if he doesn &apos;t , impeach him .
it &apos;s basically a who &apos;s who in the rino world .
tom , you have to focus .
but cruz cannot win and rubio i can never vote for .
only fund obamacare to the $ $ $ obama said it would cost .
i hope you do because the president is not doing anything .
sir , she is grossly uninformed and unqualified for this position .
we don &apos;t need drones <UNK> at our <UNK> government works for us .
no american should be forced into socialized medicine .
your awsome rand ! !
hang with them rand !
no more taxes !
and has been ignoring our constitution , invading our privacy plus destroying our country .
christie sucks .....
are you running these illegals out of sc yet ?
happy new year from texas , senator scott .
obamacare is the republican plan .
shame on you marco .
@ gus , greg harper doesn &apos;t care .
no politics involved .
obama has turned american dream into <UNK>
it was declared a tax by the supreme idiots .
then i guess i like &quot; wacko birds ! &quot;
do you republican law makers have no backbone ?
i never could figure out if lindsey was a republican or democrat .
none , absolutely none will get my vote next time !
it should be rare that legislation be greater in length than the constitution !
god bless america , land that i love .
you are a precious person , johnny .
you sir , in my opinion are serving your position well .
you too tim scott !
standing in prayer for you ; god &apos;s blessings .
typical lying from the left to waste more of our tax dollars .
the same was done for fast &amp; furious .
well done kentucky !
i think our president is overstepping his authority .
i happened to be on a flight yesterday with marco from miami to <UNK> .
you have now solidly proven that you are no &quot; conservative &quot; .
i hope diane black did too .
a man who believes in the constitution
yet the irs and insurance companies are hiring !
mr speaker sounds good to me .
the republican party sold its soul to the devil decades ago .
nice work , rep. elise stefanik .
true ... this is coming from mr. pauls office
i hope you are tried for treason .
merry christmas and prayers for a brighter 2016 .
go back to the <UNK> club and party like you usually do , vern .
our tax code is ridiculous - we need the fair tax !
america is blind , true patriots <UNK> and prepare .
let him veto and be a fool all he likes .
i &apos;m in for flat or fair tax .
no , lindsey .
the confederate flag is a piece of cloth .
do something , quit talking about it .
&quot; i think the speaker overstepped his bounds . &quot;
it will stop obamacare in its tracks .
congratulations , tom .
repealing or improving it is .
obama needs some &quot; <UNK> &quot; on his little <UNK> head ... !
rand , my mom likes you and she lives in <UNK> .
oh yeah , that &apos;s a great plan , mr .
so the plan cannot simply be repeal obamacare .
also , wish you wouldn &apos;t have voted for boehner .
a little too late !
to late sir you are a traitor
congressman it was an honor speaking with you last evening .
i don &apos;t know how anyone can support devos .
the feds don &apos;t know how to do anything right except spend money .
this was no debate of any substance .
resign gowdy ... you are an amnesty supporting fraud .
trey - i doubt you do anything about it .
happy thanks giving to you trey
the old guard will never receive another penny from this republican .
close down the epa , the state dept . , dept .
it needs to remain open &amp; why not send obama there !
i miss jeb
lied about illegal immigration and border security .
you would have made such a great president sen. mccain .
no path to citizenship for anyone or their <UNK> who came here <UNK> period !
now you need 67 votes to override obama veto .
way to represent the american people , marsha !
no way will i be victimized willingly .
mr. gowdy , why haven &apos;t they started impeachment proceedings against obama ?
merry christmas congressman reichert and family .
american conservatives have lost hope in both houses .
stand your ground col. better yet , stand fast our constitution .
good bye , paul .
rand can you see what the <UNK> are doing ?
and yet , the rinos do nothing
god bless you , mia love .
sir , the debt is no problem to obama .
but , you had nothing to say about that traitor !
i respect and agree with everything trey says .
lou barletta is a fellow coal cracker from <UNK> .
after impeachment then prosecution for treason and the deportation ... get it
support defunding / <UNK> obamacare .
the house was granted the power of the purse for this very reason .
we are praying !
no to war rand .
right now cuba is an island prison .
there are so many lost people who need the lord !
then they will try and kill our military with that equipment .
well sir your position on immigration is well expensive
take advantage of these <UNK> , but don &apos;t let them effect your principles .
amen now comes florida ! ! ! !
don &apos;t ever quit sen. graham , we need you
congress and house , please take obama &apos;s credit card from him
flat tax no irs !
scott , i think the meetings went well especially the one in <UNK> .
they will never take them away we the people want stand for it .
your establishment and <UNK> conservative created this mess .
enough talking and no action .
go git em rand 2016 !
we south carolinians are proud of mr. gowdy !
i love congressman yoho but i was scared .
so mr. gowdy who will be prosecuted ?
can we trust the current administration to enforce the laws on the books nope .
you &apos;re just jealous of mia , trying to steal her thunder .
praying for you to help lead the nation in the right direction .
just get back on the <UNK> , marco .
none of you do your job and are just wasting our time .
charlie crist is a rino .
so sorry james !
true americans will never give up !
&quot; to legislate in an independent and conservative manner . &quot;
senator corker and senator alexander have lost my vote .
there should be no cr in the first place .
wake up people and lets stop giving or selling our own country .
vote no to cloture &amp; vote yes to defund obamacare !
you and graham need to relax and let the president fulfill his campaign promises .
marco , i like you but this is not a smart move .
it &apos;s a shame that you do not listen to your constituents .
very poor , self-serving decision on your part mr. enzi .
talk talk , talk talk ....
why can &apos;t we find a conservative to challenge her ?
are you saying obama didn &apos;t bring us back from the brink ?
lindsey said the following &quot; i would prefer ( gov .
what are you and the republican majority going to do about it ?
praying for wisdom , peace god &apos;s blessing on you all
ben sasse is doing a major <UNK> right now .
wait , o does not have to follow the law .
obummer did the same thing . &quot;
my condolences to senator scott and his family .
impeach him now <UNK> it &apos;s to late 3 : )
congressman lamborn please find away to get the u.s. on track to energy independence .
say hi to hagan for me .
you are not an american , you are nothing but a republican !
it &apos;s time the conservatives and libertarians form a grand new party .
in your face mr. paul .
defund it or be voted out
that question is too logical for a <UNK> to understand , tom mcclintock !
i used to think that you had class , rand .
after this ..... holder isn &apos;t going any where obama is <UNK> the <UNK>
we wanted a balanced budget .
remember there is a big difference between electing conservatives and electing constitutionalists .
they are working so hard to cut any aid to those babies they can .
marco was awesome in <UNK> .
the only clear action in this issue is to secure our border first .
as far away from thom <UNK> as possible , please .
no problem all is well <UNK> .
lets go ron paul !
apparently mr paul has a separate situation with mr king .
it violates our privacy .
no <UNK> aid to anyone until the us is back in the black !
finally someone with the guts to take on the system .
he just wants to hurt america and its ppl .
he took an oath of office to uphold the constitution .
the republicans should start the impeachment of president obama .
back to the issues .... ty sen mccain .
yall went <UNK> 20 <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .. yall r idiots
we are paying for ss , so how about cutting wasteful military spending .
let &apos;s pray that the federal reserve gets shut down .
god bless and with god &apos;s speed stop this !
congressman mike pompeo has taken the right stand .
we in texas are pulling for you , mia .
he is going to do whatever keeps israel safe .
congress has nothing to do with whether obama wins or loses .
keep making <UNK> rand .
well said lindsey ..
that went no where fast and only make the people more furious .
i think mccain is a under cover liberal / democrat
today you sold out the gun owners of north carolina and the republicans out !
illegals should be punished , not rewarded .
i hope this endorsement is not too little too late !
what stupid obama can &apos;t grasp .
i would suggest a fair tax .
personnel tax &apos;s gone &amp; replaced with a national sales tax .
eliminates the irs , the flat tax does not .
talk talk talk , that &apos;s all they do .
but withholding or cutting aid significantly will send a message .
.... yep
when putin looks more competent than our president ... maybe its time we impeach !
why , tom ?
rubio portman 2016 ?
good news mia !
rand is one of the few that fight .
trey gowdy stand your ground &amp; stay in the fight .
tom , you are smarter than this .
a vote for cloture was a vote for obamacare .
he is very wrong ! !
say impeach and say <UNK> the irs
you will not get this republicans vote towards your next election .
even the few he does answer , nothing happens .
guess tsa doesn &apos;t exactly mean to save america ! !
get rid of irs !
who is the big government big spending candidate ?
we all know mccain was in hillary camp
no one believes a word you say paul ! !
the man is a traitor to this country .
i can &apos;t believe you voted to send jets to known terrorist !
praying for comfort &amp; peace to the marines families .
my little american boy is serving in the military .
removing that flag is going to do nothing but <UNK> ....
we need to get the commies out of america .
he is such a great human being , god bless you marco rubio
im beginning to think rand paul &apos;s on drugs ....
we are forced to have a balanced budget to live within our means .
and to you and yours , mr gowdy
he hasn &apos;t helped the us since he has been office .
enough if the john mccain crowd fight or surrender .
merry christmas mr gowdy and a happy new year .
prayers up in the name of jesus christ .
i pray everyday for an awakening in america .
obamacare needs to be repealed and <UNK> .
happy thanksgiving to you and your family trey gowdy
i am <UNK> in you and tim scott .
fire the whole bunch at election time !
vote also against obama care
paul ryan you are so late ...
marsha blackburn , you are full of hot air !
he blessed us with you serving in congress for us .
why hasn &apos;t he been impeached for treason ?
you are welcome sir !
just like congress to not understand the constitution .
our president and congress swear to uphold our constitution .
hoping congress can change this veto
you know irs and nsa are only the tip of the <UNK> iceberg .
i &apos;m proud of my flag and will always <UNK> it .
amen and god bless senator
remember the republicans that failed the people &apos;s nominee and vote them out !
by appointing conservative judges to the supreme court .
you had a funded government that defunded obamacare and you turned it down .
i think johnny <UNK> mom is also his aunt
<UNK> marco , he didn &apos;t ask you 🙄
this amnesty was passed before with reagan and failed .
stop giving money away to other countries !
when is congress going to do something to stop the lawlessness ?
and i am a registered republican .
yes he has risen happy <UNK> bless you trey
can &apos;t stand graham .
then get busy jerry and cut off the funding .
mia for speaker ! !
praying that we get these creeps out of office before it is to late
so one word congress / senators impeachment ! ! !
this is not the libertarian way .
obama does nothing
cruz and romney need to go home
mia , you have it so right .
and bo is illegal because of his ss .
they are ruining our schools as we speak .
we need help sir !
for further <UNK> and political <UNK> , all concerned american patriots should check out <UNK>
looks like congress got a pay raise .
no answer yet ?
you &apos;re full of it , john thune .
we trust that you will make sure the right thing is done here sir .
it &apos;s just another thing obama can shove down our throats !
you are absolutely right , senator mccain .
what about securing our borders mr. mccain ?
i believe that he stands on constitutional principles .
he is going to be the fall of america !
mcclintock : another corporate owned empty suit .
why is eric holder still serving as attorney general ?
james , you got ours when we voted on sat .
no laura <UNK> it is not a legal law .
<UNK> ride ron paul .
very well said , mike .
i salute you ; now , remove that confederate flag from state grounds
why they don &apos;t listen anyway
i agree he is part to blame duh !
we also live in north carolina and insist you do not vote for the <UNK>
impeach this man for treason !
your a true patriot sir
anything short of a full defunding of obamacare is stopping too short .
time to pass a straight budget with no <UNK> <UNK> about obamacare .
no war ! !
you sir have lost my future vote ! ! ! &apos;
you &apos;re a joke moran .
mia , have you seen this report ?
something inside you trey is so refreshing and hope giving .
probably only fox news will report .
pointing out his so-called failed administration is meaningless .
impeach this president ! ! !
cloture seems to me to be in favor of obamacare
again tim the <UNK> is thanking god .
love it mia love !
good luck , mr. scott .
impeachment proceedings must be brought against this president and his extremely inept administration .
have ya &apos;ll decided how long you are gonna wait before you cave ?
obama had to clean the mess bush left .
agreed mr .
i like john mccain as a person .
the clintons can get away with anything or o it <UNK> .
cut the <UNK> wilson legacy out of our government .
you delivered john boehner to speaker .
a cr bill should be just that ... a cr bill .
i stand with you rand paul
look toward a flat tax then you could eliminate half of the irs .
get on board with the president &apos;s plan or get out of the way .
i agree mike .
defund them all , especially when it comes to the illegal immigrants .
permanent delay
trey needs to run for president !
it is unfortunate that you represent a senatorial district in my beloved georgia .
trust no one !
may our lord guide your path and bless you with his wisdom .
john russell thinks you should consider another line of work .
please pass the zadroga act and support our 911 first responders !
what are you congressmen going to do about it ?
3. no bill should be passed that is more than 100 pages long .
you and mccain are out !
impeachment please !
every welfare program the us funds is in that agriculture budget .
sounds like you are kissing azz marsha .
johnny isakson , respectfully , reconsider .
john mccain you totally suck .
stay strong and lead mr. rubio !
you have the backbone of a <UNK> sir .
impeach him out of office with all of those that he hired !
thanks for the update , james !
pray for america !
hey mr. rino !
about time ryan .
do away with obamacare .
stay the course scott .
obama is proof he was right !
and maybe while we &apos;re at it we &apos;ll put you traitors out !
mcconnell put 2 billion worth of pork for kentucky in the bill .
holder is blocking every ruling which includes their gang of thieves .
i kinda like rand paul .
the federal government has disability hiring programs but they are a joke .
then use that money to pay down debt and quit borrowing so much .
you lost my vote you rino .
true sir !
senator paul , keep up the good work .
the trust in our government is gone .
&quot; gop is for me &quot; - hispanic republican leadership in texas .
i agree with both tom &amp; jack .
i really don &apos;t listen to him because i don &apos;t beleive him
ted , start impeachment for <UNK> of duty and providing comfort to our enemies .
no taxes , period !
my husband would have been there tim .
just go away johnny !
nice try , should have backed him months ago .
the house can vote to repeal it all they want .
get rid of rino &apos;s
he has gone against our constitution more than he &apos;s been for it !
let your people of south carolina eat cake ..... karma ! ! !
go defend the constitution .
why cant you stop obama &apos;s damaging endeavors ? ? ?
we should just do a national sales tax , exempt unprepared food and medicine .
thank you so much for saying this , senator .
